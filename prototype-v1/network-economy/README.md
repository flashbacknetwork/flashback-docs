# ðŸ’° Economy

The network economy model of Flashback is designed to create a decentralized and self-sustaining ecosystem that incentivizes both storage providers and service gateway operators while maintaining economic balance across the network. At its core, Flashback leverages a dual incentive system that rewards validators for staking and securing the network through Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus while also rewarding storage providers for their data storage and retrieval services via Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt).

The model ensures that network participants are compensated fairly based on their contributions and performances. This decentralized economic framework aims to optimize resource allocation, foster participation, and promote long-term growth and stability by creating a balanced and transparent economic environment where no single entity controls or dictates the rules, thereby enabling a true peer-to-peer data economy.
