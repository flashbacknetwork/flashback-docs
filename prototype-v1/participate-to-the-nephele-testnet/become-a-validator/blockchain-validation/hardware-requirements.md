# Hardware Requirements

As Flashback inherits from the Ethereum specifications, the network can support light, complete, and archive nodes. The validator cannot make the storage duties available. Flashback does not have the history of Ethereum and can reduce certain specifications. The minimal hardware requirements must then evolve with the growth of the Flashback ecosystem. &#x20;
