# ☺️ General Specifications

Flashback is a peer-to-peer network that uses blockchain and cryptographical proofs to achieve a decentralized consensus and economy of its utilities. It has then its own specifications and goals.

## A Layer-1 Blockchain

A blockchain is a ledger that lists different accountancy operations gathered per block. Every new block is linked to its predecessor, forming a continuous chain of blocks. Gathering the operations into blocks enables frequent updates without altering the ledger and its historical operations in the 1980s and 1990s by Haber and Stornetta.&#x20;

It introduced cryptographic mechanisms to a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. This concept introduced Stornetta by introducing cryptographic mechanisms to a system wherein document [timestamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp) could not be tampered with. This concept introduced the concept of the Merkle Tree to securely verify the potential alteration of the ledger in the linkage of blocks.

A Merkle tree organizes data that helps quickly and securely verify the content of large data sets. It summarizes all the data into a small piece called the root. If any piece of the data changes, the root will also change, making it easy to spot alterations.

In 2008, the subprime crisis caused severe damage to the world, leading to years of depression. The trust in banks and centralized financial authorities led to the imagination of new approaches to supporting this trust by machines.\
\
A group of persons or an individual (who knows) called [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) decided to adopt the blockchain with a public and open-source peer-to-peer network of computers. The mission is to propose an alternative decentralized financial system where a machine-based consensus certifies the cryptographic mechanisms and the alteration of the blockchain without the need for a trusted third party.

The decentralized ledger was born with its first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, to incentivize the owners of machines to participate positively in the consensus based on the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. Bitcoin enables it to operate accountancy operations called transactions of its cryptocurrency. Nowadays, the Bitcoin network is in the category of Layer-1 blockchain, like Ethereum or Solana. It has the following characteristics:

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">Decentralized Ledger</mark>—The network maintains a distributed ledger that records all transactions and state changes. The machines in the peer-to-peer network maintaining the ledger are called network nodes or **nodes**. The technology can use existing blockchains or to have its blockchain.
2. <mark style="color:yellow;">Consensus Mechanism</mark>—Layer-1 blockchains implement consensus protocols (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof-of-Stake-Spacetime) that allow nodes to agree on the blockchain's state and validate transactions. The nodes performing the consensus process are called **validators**.&#x20;
3. <mark style="color:yellow;">Native Cryptocurrency</mark>—Most Layer-1 blockchains have a native cryptocurrency used for transactions and incentivizing network participants.&#x20;
4. <mark style="color:yellow;">Smart Contract Functionality</mark> - Some Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains support smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into the code.&#x20;

Layer-1 blockchains are critical, forming the foundation for other solutions and enhancements (like Layer-2 protocols). They provide the essential infrastructure for the operation and security of the entire blockchain ecosystem, enabling various applications from digital currencies to complex decentralized applications.

## A Primary Focus on Data Storage

The web is constantly evolving, and we're here to solve [the problem](../learn/the-problem.md) that will support a brighter future for individuals and companies. The new generation of technologies saw mass adoption when the services and applications using them significantly improved user experience (UX). In DePIN-based cloud storage, the UX is not just a feature; it's the backbone of our core technologies.\
\
How can we become the future backbone of cloud storage? This is Flashback's mission: to drive the innovations of tomorrow and its features to guarantee that:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">The storage providers must be profitable and competitive</mark>. Whatever the hardware quality provided to the network, this must be possible, but ultimately, if the hardware is of the best quality, you can find it from hardware manufacturers.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">The service providers must be efficient and cheap</mark>. The network must support an economy that pushes the token's utility to reward the best quality of services, which means a fast file download speed and lets the service providers be responsible for the design of its system in the network.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">The developers must be happy and decisive</mark>. The integration of the network must provide easy-to-use implementation frameworks. Deploying an application or a service must use what they know the best, and integrating a network as a storage medium should not be time-consuming in learning.
