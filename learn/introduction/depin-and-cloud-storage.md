# DePIN and Cloud Storage

The world is becoming increasingly numeric, where data is its fuel.  As fuel, it must be stored and distributed. The emergence of the internet and subsequent services have enabled people to effortlessly communicate, share, and store their information and data with their families, friends, governments, and other entities.&#x20;

This massive data storage makes up the foundation of Big Data—a phenomenon aimed at enhancing the quality of services and user experience through analyzing large-scale datasets or training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These new technologies brought the emergence of new applications in the supply chain, healthcare, and language inference. The data storage market made over $180 billion in revenues in 2023, and the simulation evaluates this market to be over $700 billion in 2032. (see [here](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-storage-market-102991)) Today, everyone has a mobile phone with diverse applications, which densifies the stratum of interaction in the numeric world.&#x20;

Managing and storing such large amounts of data requires an enormous infrastructure in computer science. Cloud data storage has quickly become the go-to solution companies use because of the increasing number of data breaches associated with traditional and local storage solutions, their lack of accessibility worldwide, the interoperability issues, and the deployment costs of establishing new infrastructure.

## The dawn of cloud storage with centralized operators

Whereas personal computers were the best data storage medium in the 80s, the need for faster data transfer rates and more efficient storage solutions propelled the adoption of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) via the Internet as time progressed. At the end of the '90s, large IT firms imagined creating a distributed network globally to provide total accessibility to its data. This gives the foundation for integrating streaming platforms and social media into our daily lives.&#x20;

This new generation of data storage is dominating the data storage market segment, with a total revenue of $99.2 billion in 2023. The cloud data storage market emerged, featuring companies such as Google, Amazon Web Services, Baidu, and Microsoft, now leaders in the industry.

Centralizing and consolidating power among these major companies has led to many concerns regarding data privacy, legal compliance, and data governance, particularly in Europe. Furthermore, the escalating number of data breaches each year demonstrates the growing vulnerability in centralized solutions, reflecting increasing interest among hackers. Moreover, centralized solutions can potentially subject data to foreign censorship, compromise privacy by sharing foreign customers' data, or increase storage fees, which doubled from 2018 to 2023.

## A new hope with decentralized physical infrastructure networks

### What is DePIN?

Today, the web3 ecosystem is seeing the birth of dozens of projects whose aim is to contribute, in their way, to the building of a decentralized, user-governed web. To realize their ambitions, entrepreneurs and developers in this ecosystem are developing a range of protocols, services, and infrastructure networks to meet specific needs. In particular, blockchain technology and decentralized proofs of consensus have been significant features of the web3 paradigm. As a nascent universe, existing technologies are still in a priming phase, seeking to solve fundamental problems that words cannot resolve.

In the plethora of Web3 infrastructure, the projects that embrace real-world use cases are called decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). Decentralized Finance (DeFi) focuses on improving transactions and financial gains through blockchain technology. Still, DePIN connects an ensemble of physical infrastructure with a blockchain network for a specific utility beyond the financial interest of the blockchain itself. It can be a network for data storage, WiFi deployment, machine-to-machine communication, self-driving cars, and more. This network often combines multiple cutting-edge technologies, including blockchain and cryptography. A DePIN solution can have a granularity of its decentralization.

### Decentralization Levels in DePIN

While many consider this aspect sufficient, the decentralization in DePIN is not always the same, resulting in different governance or security concerns for their users. Different levels of DePIN technologies can be compared to self-driving levels:

* **Level 1**: Service providers can freely deploy on top of the network. The service can freely interact and manage its business model according to the network parameters. Here, no single third party can censor a service's network use.
* **Level 2**: The physical infrastructure providers can freely contribute to the network. The provider can create a blockchain node and provide its infrastructure to the network based on the open-access documentation. The provider receives its income from the network according to specified rules coded in the network. No third party controls the income provided to the provider or limits access to the network.
* **Level 3**: The network uses a cryptography-proof-based permissionless consensus mechanism to certify and reward the honest workload related to its purpose (cloud storage, cloud computing, etc.). The proof consensus is entirely independent of human action or pseudo-automation and based on verifiable cryptographic evidence.&#x20;
* **Level 4**: The network has a permissionless network economy model. The reward mechanism of infrastructure nodes is wholly independent of human action or pseudo-automation (software-defined reward scheme instead of network consensus validation). The block-based reward is irregular and dependent on the number of validators. The infrastructure provider itself entirely defines the contract-based reward (fees for using the network node). There is no liquidity pool to reward network nodes, and no entity (company or DAO) receives a network fee based on its use.
* **Level 5**: No single third party controls the network's evolution. No third party can decide the network's features and how they should evolve. Most of the network’s participants can only make changes with pure on-chain proposals. The network consensus only improves the code(elimination of the git repository).&#x20;

### DePIN-based cloud storage

The concept of these solutions is based on a blockchain in a peer-to-peer network, which drives a decentralized economy model supported by consensus and an ensemble of rules. This philosophy comes from Satoshi with Bitcoin, but these DePIN solutions focus on cloud storage problems. It brings multiple advantages compared to centralized solutions:

* **Lower cybersecurity costs**: The existing blockchain brings more security by having a public, transparent, and freely auditable code and infrastructure, reducing the cybersecurity costs implied today in centralized solutions.&#x20;
* **Permissionless and privacy:**  The decentralization guarantees that an organization can't censor the data storage itself. An individual or a company can interact with the network protocols without requiring the authorization of a central entity or a service provider. Anyone can decide to become a storage provider by offering its storage hardware to the network.
* **Pricing competitiveness:** Individuals or service providers using the network can decide to manage their storage by selecting the protocols and nodes they want to interact with. It minimizes the risk of data losses, and users can play with the network node pricing to optimize their profitability. This stimulates the competitiveness between storage providers always to find the best hardware setup and installation.

The first development of DePIN-based cloud storage started in 2014 with the projects of STORJ and Filecoin. Today, we can count a dozen projects providing DePIN cloud storage. The solutions present numerous challenges that drastically restrain their usage (see future article). Many DePINs reached the level 2, but projects like Filecoin or Sia reached the level 3. However, a project like Filecoin decided to create an additional subsystem called Filecoin Plus, a level-1 DePIN, because the miners can’t integrate this subsystem without central permission.&#x20;
