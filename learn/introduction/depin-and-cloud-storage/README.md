# The Advent of centralized Cloud Storage

The world is becoming increasingly numeric, where data is its fuel. As fuel, it must be stored and distributed. The emergence of the internet and subsequent services have enabled people to effortlessly communicate, share, and store their information and data with their families, friends, governments, and other entities.

This massive data storage makes up the foundation of Big Data—a phenomenon aimed at enhancing the quality of services and user experience through analyzing large-scale datasets or training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These new technologies brought the emergence of new applications in the supply chain, healthcare, and language inference. The data storage market made over $180 billion in revenues in 2023, and the simulation evaluates this market to be over $700 billion in 2032. (see [here](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-storage-market-102991)) Today, everyone has a mobile phone with diverse applications, which densifies the stratum of interaction in the numeric world.

Managing and storing such large amounts of data requires an enormous computer science infrastructure. Cloud data storage has quickly become the go-to solution for companies because of the increasing number of data breaches associated with traditional and local storage solutions, their lack of accessibility worldwide, the interoperability issues, and the deployment costs of establishing new infrastructure.

Let's explore together this fantastic and obscure world that orchestrates the future of our world.

_Let's have a journey in the early stage of the data storage odyssey with the first hardware that allows computer science to become the cornerstone of our society._

## [The Market](the-market.md)

_Often missing in the web3 ecosystem, the market analysis represents an obvious and necessary step to build future technology properly and better understand the dominance of giant technology companies._

## [Adoption Drivers](adoption-drivers.md)

It is always chaotic to know what the future will be. However, Cloud storage has become very popular because of key adoption drivers related to the evolution of the Internet and computers at the end of the 1990s.

## [Model and Service Type](model-and-service-type.md)

_Cloud storage is not only a concept but also articulates many concepts that enable deploying different models and service types. It is wobbly to think one is better than another as the evolution of the Cloud is mainly related to hardware and habit changes._

## [Market Trends](market-trends.md)

_As hardware technology evolves and more businesses adopt Cloud storage, novel trends emerge with recent applications like artificial intelligence while integrating green energies in the datacenter power mix._&#x20;

## [Titans of the Market](titans-of-the-market.md)

_Amazon, Google, Microsoft—we all know them, but let's have a quick overview of their tentacular companies._

## [Navigating the Challenges](navigating-the-challenges.md)

_Centralized Cloud storage is facing specific challenges by developing solutions to respect the market trends while strictly respecting their business model._
