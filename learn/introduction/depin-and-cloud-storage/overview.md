# Overview

Whereas personal computers were the best data storage medium in the 80s, the need for faster data transfer rates and more efficient storage solutions propelled the adoption of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) via the Internet as time progressed. At the end of the '90s, large IT firms imagined creating a distributed network globally to provide total accessibility to its data. This gives the foundation for integrating streaming platforms and social media into our daily lives.

The global cloud data storage market has been experiencing robust growth, driven by the increasing volume of data generated by individuals and enterprises and the ongoing digital transformation across various industries.
