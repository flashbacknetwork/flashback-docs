# Segmentation

## **By Deployment Model**

### **Public Cloud**

The public cloud model commands the largest market share due to the extensive offerings from leading providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Public cloud storage solutions are highly scalable and cost-effective, appealing to many businesses and individual users.

This segment is expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 13.5% through 2028. The growth is driven by the increasing adoption of cloud services for data storage, computing power, and analytics. Public cloud providers offer extensive global infrastructure, which supports a wide range of applications and industries, further accelerating market expansion.

### **Private Cloud**

Private cloud solutions are experiencing significant growth, particularly among enterprises with stringent security, compliance, and control requirements. Unlike public clouds, private clouds are dedicated to a single organization, offering greater customization and privacy.

The private cloud market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of around 11.9% through 2028. The increasing need for enhanced data security and compliance with regulatory requirements, such as GDPR and HIPAA fuels this growth. Organizations are investing in private clouds to manage sensitive data and critical applications more securely and with greater control.

### **Hybrid Cloud**

The hybrid cloud model, which combines elements of both public and private clouds, is becoming increasingly popular for its flexibility and optimization capabilities. This model allows businesses to leverage the scalability of public clouds while maintaining critical or sensitive workloads on private clouds.

Hybrid cloud deployments are expected to grow at a robust CAGR of about 14.2% through 2028. The hybrid approach enables organizations to optimize their IT resources, improve operational efficiency, and balance cost with performance. As businesses seek to modernize their IT infrastructure and adapt to evolving needs, the hybrid cloud model provides an ideal solution for integrating diverse cloud environments and enhancing overall agility.

## **By Service Type**

### **Object Storage**

Object storage holds a substantial market share due to its effectiveness in managing and storing unstructured data, such as documents, media files, and backups. This storage model organizes data into flexible, self-contained objects, which can be easily accessed and managed through metadata and unique identifiers.

The growing use of data analytics, big data applications, and cloud-native applications contributes significantly to the demand for object storage. Services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage are leading the market by providing scalable, durable, and cost-efficient solutions that support massive data volumes and high availability.

Object storage is increasingly adopted across various industries, including media and entertainment, healthcare, and finance, where large volumes of unstructured data need to be efficiently managed and accessed.

### **Block Storage**

Block storage is essential for applications requiring high performance and low latency, such as databases, virtual machines, and transactional applications. This model divides data into blocks and stores them in separate volumes, allowing for quick access and efficient data management.

The demand for block storage is driven by the need for fast, reliable, and scalable storage solutions that support mission-critical applications. Major providers like Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store), Google Persistent Disk, and Azure Disk Storage offer high-performance block storage services that cater to applications requiring intensive I/O operations.

As businesses increasingly rely on data-intensive applications and high-speed data processing, the need for robust block storage solutions continues to rise. The market for block storage is expanding as enterprises seek to enhance application performance and reduce latency.

### **File Storage**

File storage remains crucial for managing and sharing files in a structured manner, making it ideal for applications that require file-level access and collaboration. This storage model organizes data into hierarchical file structures, such as directories and folders, which are easy to navigate and manage.

The continued use of collaborative tools, content management systems, and enterprise file-sharing solutions drives the demand for file storage. Services like AWS EFS (Elastic File System) and Azure Files provide scalable and managed file storage solutions that support various applications and use cases, from simple file sharing to complex enterprise workloads.

File storage solutions are increasingly used in scenarios where traditional file systems are needed, such as in content management, collaborative projects, and shared file systems. As businesses adopt more collaborative and remote work environments, the demand for scalable and accessible file storage solutions continues to grow.
