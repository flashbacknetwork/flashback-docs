# Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)

Centralizing and consolidating power among these major companies has led to many concerns regarding data privacy, legal compliance, and governance. Furthermore, the escalating number of data breaches each year demonstrates the growing vulnerability in centralized solutions, reflecting increasing interest among hackers. Moreover, centralized solutions can potentially subject data to foreign censorship, compromise privacy by sharing foreign customers' data, or increase cloud fees, which doubled from 2018 to 2023. For instance, you can visit this website (see [here](https://www.veritas.com/fr/fr/resources/dark-data#%7B%22sliderValue%22%3A0%2C%22companyName%22%3A%22%22%2C%22selectedCountry%22%3A%22USA%22%7D)) to visualize companies' expenses in data storage.

The concept of these solutions is based on a blockchain in a peer-to-peer network, which drives a decentralized economy model supported by consensus and an ensemble of rules. This philosophy, originating from Satoshi with Bitcoin, is now applied to cloud problems.&#x20;
