# What is DePIN?

Today, the web3 ecosystem is seeing the birth of dozens of projects whose aim is to contribute, in their way, to the building of a decentralized, user-governed web. To realize their ambitions, entrepreneurs and developers in this ecosystem are developing a range of protocols, services, and infrastructure networks to meet specific needs. In particular, blockchain technology and decentralized proofs of consensus have been significant features of the web3 paradigm. As a nascent universe, existing technologies are still in a priming phase, seeking to solve fundamental problems that words cannot resolve.

In the plethora of Web3 infrastructure, the projects that embrace real-world use cases are called decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN). Decentralized Finance (DeFi) focuses on improving transactions and financial gains through blockchain technology. Still, DePIN connects an ensemble of physical infrastructure with a blockchain network for a specific utility beyond the financial interest of the blockchain itself. It can be a network for data storage, WiFi deployment, machine-to-machine communication, self-driving cars, and more. This network often combines multiple cutting-edge technologies, including blockchain and cryptography. A DePIN solution can have a granularity of its decentralization.
