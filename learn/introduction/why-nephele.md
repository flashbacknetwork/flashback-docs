# Why Nephele?

The problem with current DePIN-based cloud storage is the exact condition of the slow adoption of web3 technologies. If a web3 business or applications pay the costs of centralized giant companies, then they can't outperform the centralized competitors.&#x20;

Nephele, our innovative DePIN-based Cloud Storage for Web3 and AI services, solves the poor user experience plagues traditional DePIN storage solutions. It offers a competitive decentralized alternative to Big Tech solutions in the $108 billion cloud data storage market, setting itself apart with its unique features and benefits.

The solution is based on 3 principles:

* **Guaranteeing profitability**: The storage infrastructure providers are the cornerstone of a DePIN solution. Unfortunately, many projects prefer developing a solution related to a marketing strategy rather than meeting operators' demands. They develop modular blockchain solutions instead of ensuring the storage infrastructure providers benefit from the whole ecosystem. Nephele's storage provider will also be a validator to support the best security and decentralization supported by our novel algorithm, the [proof-of-stake-spacetime](../our-network-and-ecosystem/blockchain-network/consensus-proof-of-stake-spacetime.md), and an on-chain storage marketplace where every validator will activate their contribution to the storage and define their operating fees.
* **Optimizing the file transfer speed**: The web3 service running with a DePIN solution must benefit from an optimal quality of storage providers (ka the data availability). The competitors focus on growing the storage capacity provided to the network but create an unbalanced reward model. The storage providers must optimize their data availability; the only approach is incentivizing it and slashing the bad actors. The [quality-of-network optimizer](../our-network-and-ecosystem/storage-mechanisms/quality-of-network-qon-optimizer.md) allows storage providers to collect their operating fees if one of its validators is the best answer to data requests from a network user's file.&#x20;
* **Network integration**: The Ethereum ecosystem is leading the development of decentralized applications and services, supporting 60% of the total value locked in the web3 ecosystem. Filecoin, along with its FVM and other projects (AIOZ, Crust, etc.), all support the EVM. Nephele has forked the Ethereum codebase and has the full [Ethereum stack](../our-network-and-ecosystem/blockchain-network/ethereum-stack-in-nephele/). The data storage must be easily integrated into traditional services or dApps. However, these projects support a unique protocol, IPFS, and it reduces the freedom of developers and businesses to stick with the specifications of their clients. Nephele is a unique solution that is protocol-agnostic for file transfers with its network.&#x20;

Nephele provides the foundation for the competitiveness and adoption of all the web services and applications connected to its blockchain and different layers.
