# Network Economy

The network economy model of Flashback is designed to create a decentralized and self-sustaining ecosystem that incentivizes both storage providers and service gateway operators while maintaining economic balance across the network. At its core, Flashback leverages a dual incentive system that rewards validators for staking and securing the network through Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus while also rewarding storage providers for their data storage and retrieval services via Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt).&#x20;

The model ensures that network participants are compensated fairly based on their contributions and performances. This decentralized economic framework aims to optimize resource allocation, foster participation, and promote long-term growth and stability by creating a balanced and transparent economic environment where no single entity controls or dictates the rules, thereby enabling a true peer-to-peer data economy.
