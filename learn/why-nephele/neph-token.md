## Introduction



## Tokenized Credits



## **Between Applications and Flashback**

* **Payments:** All payments can be made in tokens.
* **Fees Benefits:** All the fees will receive a large discount if the payment is complete in tokens.
* **Options Benefits:** All the options will receive a large discount if the payment is complete in tokens.
* **Staking:** Consumers can stake tokens to participate in the platform governance and have the following advantages:
  * **Tiered Fee Structure:** Lower fees as transaction volumes or usage milestones are reached (e.g., 1% fee for <100 SLA/month, 0.5% for > 100 transactions/month).
  * **Token Incentives:** Reward transaction fees for active users.
  * **Tiered Plans:** Offer tokens for active users as rewards in the tiered plans.&#x20;
  * **Rewards for Achievements:** The consumer will receive rewards for reaching certain milestones and improving the quality of services (e.g., providing scoring).
* **Penalties:** Slash the stake or increase fees with the platform or penalties for the unused payment locked in the contract if the consumer does not provide adequate scoring and report with the platform and the smart contracts.

## **Between Infrastructure Providers and Flashback**&#x20;



* **SLA Fees Benefits:** All the fees will receive a large discount if the storage provider pays in tokens.
* **Options Benefits:** All the options will receive a large discount if the payment is complete in tokens.
* **Staking:** Storage providers can stake tokens to be authorized for operations. If the token is staked, then the storage provider can receive the following bonuses:
  * **Risk Offset:** If no penalty is received, the storage provider can receive an offset for providing hardware to support maintenance costs for an initial period.
  * **Token Incentives:** By respecting the QoS proposed in the marketplace, the storage providers may receive an additional bonus in tokens as a percentage of the payments received for SLAs
  * **Rewards for Achievements:** By submitting legal information (registration to the compliance system) or reaching milestones, the storage provider will receive rewards.
* **Penalties:** Slash the stake or increase fees with the platform or lock penalties from the contract's paymentif the provider does not provide an adequate report in the smart contract or does not respect the QoS terms in the SLA.&#x20;



These centralized Cloud providers mainly use pay-as-you-go payments, enabling companies to buy and spend credits. So Flashback will be a platform that tokenizes its credits for these customers, offering a single token for various credits available from different Cloud providers.
