# Our Network

Today, the development of web3 technologies has led to the emergence of new concepts that break with traditional technologies. Decentralized networks have made it possible to implement new technologies and concepts.

## General Overview of Flashback Network

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Flashback_diagram (1).svg" alt=""><figcaption><p>A high-level diagram of the different layers interacting in the Flashback Network</p></figcaption></figure>

The **Flashback Network** is designed as a decentralized, trust-enforced system that connects consumers and storage providers while maintaining transparency through smart contracts. **Storage Providers** and **Consumers** interact indirectly through **blockchain-based orchestrators**, which ensure compliance and streamline data and payment flows. The **Flashback Platform** core registers and listings enhance discoverability, trust, and accountability, supporting a reliable decentralized storage ecosystem.

### **1. Top Layer: Roles (Storage Providers and Consumers)**

* **Storage Providers**:&#x20;
  * These represent entities offering storage spaces, such as decentralized or traditional storage systems.&#x20;
  * Providers are responsible for offering storage capacity to consumers and must meet the platform’s quality standards or consumers' requirements.&#x20;
  * These providers can be registered and certified within the Flashback platform for trust and compliance.
* **Consumers**:
  * Represent individuals, organizations, or applications requiring storage solution.&#x20;
  * Consumers interact with storage providers via smart contract orchestrators to store, retrieve, or manage their data.

### **2. Middle Layer: Smart Contract Orchestrators**

Both orchestrators communicate through the **Flashback platform**, ensuring that SLAs, payments, and quality metrics are synchronized and enforced.

* **Orchestrator for Storage Providers**:
  * Manages agreements, service-level parameters, and quality monitoring for storage providers.
  * Orchestrate the **P2P streams** by enforcing transparency and compliance in transactions.
* **Orchestrator for Consumers**:
  * Handles payments, data access permissions, and SLA terms to ensure fair usage.
  * Provides a decentralized mechanism for consumers to interact seamlessly with storage providers.

You can find more explanations



1. **Storage Providers → Smart Contract Orchestrators**:
   * Providers register with the Flashback platform through the **left orchestrator**, which ensures their services align with platform standards.
   * All storage-related activities (e.g., contracts, rewards, and compliance checks) flow through this orchestrator.
2. **Consumers → Smart Contract Orchestrators**:
   * Consumers interact via the **right orchestrator**, which manages payments, data access, and SLA execution.
   * Consumers choose certified providers from the listings or registers maintained by the Flashback platform.
3. **Flashback Platform as the Hub**:
   * Serves as the central layer, linking **storage providers** and **consumers** via smart contracts while ensuring transparency and accountability.
   * Hosts the certification registers and listings, ensuring quality and trust in the ecosystem.

#### **Interactions Between Layers**

***

* **Register of Certified Storage Providers**:
  * A database within the Flashback platform that lists storage providers meeting certification requirements.
  * Certification ensures providers meet quality-of-service (QoS) standards and comply with SLAs.
* **Register of Certified Service Providers**:
  * Similar to the storage provider register, this registry certifies service providers offering auxiliary services (e.g., data migration, analytics, or compliance tools).
  * Supports a robust ecosystem by vetting reliable providers.
* **Listing**:
  * Acts as a public interface where storage and service providers are listed for consumers to browse and choose from.
  * Facilitates discovery and selection while maintaining transparency about certifications and performance ratings.

#### **3. Bottom Layer: Flashback Platform Core**

***

* Both orchestrators communicate through the **Flashback platform**, ensuring that SLAs, payments, and quality metrics are synchronized and enforced.

**Interaction**:

* **Orchestrator for Storage Providers (Left)**:
  * Likely operating on a blockchain like **Stellar**, this smart contract handles interactions with storage providers.
  * Manages agreements, service-level parameters, and quality monitoring for storage providers.
  * Enables **P2P streams** by enforcing transparency and compliance in transactions.
* **Orchestrator for Consumers (Right)**:
  * Operating on another blockchain (e.g., **Starknet**), it manages consumer-side interactions.
  * Handles payments, data access permissions, and SLA terms to ensure fair usage.
  * Provides a decentralized mechanism for consumers to interact seamlessly with storage providers.
