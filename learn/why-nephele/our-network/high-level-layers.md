# High-Level Layers

Today, the development of web3 technologies has led to the emergence of new concepts that break with traditional technologies. Decentralized networks have made it possible to implement new technologies and concepts.

The **Flashback Network** is designed as a decentralized, trust-enforced system that connects consumers and storage providers while maintaining transparency through smart contracts. **Storage Providers** and **Consumers** interact indirectly through **blockchain-based orchestrators**, which ensure compliance and streamline data and payment flows. The **Flashback Platform** core registers and listings enhance discoverability, trust, and accountability, supporting a reliable decentralized storage ecosystem.

## **Storage Layer: Roles (Storage Providers and Consumers)**

* **Storage Providers**:&#x20;
  * These represent entities offering storage spaces, such as decentralized or traditional storage systems.&#x20;
  * Providers are responsible for offering storage capacity to consumers and must meet the platformâ€™s quality standards or consumers' requirements.&#x20;
  * These providers can be registered and certified within the Flashback platform for trust and compliance.
* **Consumers**:
  * Represent individuals, organizations, or applications requiring storage solution.&#x20;
  * Consumers interact with storage providers via smart contract orchestrators to store, retrieve, or manage their data.

## **Blockchain Layer: Smart Contract Orchestrators**

Both orchestrators communicate through the **Flashback platform**, ensuring that SLAs, payments, and quality metrics are synchronized and enforced.

* **Orchestrator for Storage Providers**:
  * Manages agreements, service-level parameters, and quality monitoring for storage providers.
  * Orchestrate the **P2P streams** by enforcing transparency and compliance in transactions.
* **Orchestrator for Consumers**:
  * Handles payments, data access permissions, and SLA terms to ensure fair usage.
  * Provides a decentralized mechanism for consumers to interact seamlessly with storage providers.

## **Flashback Platform Core**

* **Register of Certified Storage Providers**:
  * A database within the Flashback platform that lists storage providers meeting certification requirements.
  * Certification ensures providers meet quality-of-service (QoS) standards and can be trusted for SLAs.
* **Register of Certified Service Providers**:
  * Like the storage provider register, this registry certifies service providers offering auxiliary services (e.g., data migration, analytics, or compliance tools).
  * Supports a robust ecosystem by vetting reliable providers.
* **Listing**:
  * Acts as a public interface where storage and service providers are listed for consumers to browse and choose from.
  * Facilitates discovery and selection while maintaining transparency about certifications and performance ratings.
