# Introduction

## The Problem

Due to a lack of trust in centralized cloud providers, 93% of organizations use a multi-cloud strategy, and 87% combine public and private clouds in hybrid environments.&#x20;

Today, these companies in web3 or conventional businesses are suffering from three pain points:

* Multi-cloud solutions present a single point of failure in file transfers. According to a Deloitte Insights survey, organizations spend around 10.9% of their IT budget on cybersecurity.
* Hybrid cloud solutions are expensive to manage. According to a Flexera study, 82% of companies have a hybrid cloud strategy, but 30% of cloud spending is wasted due to poor management.
* DePin-based cloud solutions have slow file retrieval, which is only good for cold storage (archives). According to "The State of DeStor 2024" report, 62% of IT decision-makers believe decentralized storage is as reliable or more reliable than traditional cloud solutions. However, 72% are not yet using these solutions, due to complexity, low quality-of-services (QoS) for storage providers, security, and compliance concerns.

## The Solution

To overcome this problem, Flashback proposes developing a DePin-based multi-cloud platform that offers fast data retrieval while being a flexible payment manager for service-level agreements (SLA).&#x20;

We are proposing the following:

* Decentralized SLAs: ...
* Pay-as-you-need: ...
* QoS Incentivizing: ...
