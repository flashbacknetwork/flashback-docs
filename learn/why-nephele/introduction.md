# ðŸš« The Problem

AI, Web3, and other data-heavy applications are fueling a surge in demand for cloud storage, an $180B market driven by the need for hot data storage. While the current market is dominated by major centralized players, they are expensive and result in AI and Web3 companies having high cybersecurity expenses to manage single points of failure. This leaves companies [open to hacking](https://protos.com/users-of-hacked-mixin-network-question-projects-decentralized-nature/), limits users' control over the data ecosystems they contribute to, and highlights millions of businesses' dependency on just a few providers.

To mitigate risk, companies often adopt multi-cloud strategies, but they still face inefficiencies in cost management, misaligned resource allocation, and a lack of privacy and governance. Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePin) have emerged as an alternative for hybrid and multi-cloud implementation, offering superior geographic distribution, security, and privacy for certain use cases. Yet, these solutions are frequently limited by complex integrations, poor quality of services, and slow data retrieval speeds, making them mainly only suitable for cold storage and high-latency computing.

Though decentralized providers like ZÃ¼s or Hivenet show promise, most businesses remain tied to existing public cloud workflows, with engineers hesitant to adopt unfamiliar, often complex, DePin technology stacks.&#x20;

:warning: **In short, thereâ€™s currently no solution that bridges the user-friendly experience of centralized cloud technologies with the innovation, privacy, and distribution of DePin providers.**

Achieving widespread adoption of Web3 technologies depends on closing this gap and delivering a hybrid approach that unites both worlds effectively.
