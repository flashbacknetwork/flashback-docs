# ðŸš« The Problem

AI, Web3, and other data-heavy applications fuel a surge in demand for cloud storage, a $180B market driven by the need for hot data storage. The current market is dominated by major centralized players, which are expensive and result in AI and Web3 companies having high cybersecurity expenses to manage single points of failure. This leaves companies [open to hacking](https://protos.com/users-of-hacked-mixin-network-question-projects-decentralized-nature/), limits users' control over the data ecosystems they contribute to, and highlights millions of businesses' dependency on just a few providers.

Businesses have decided to develop hybrid and multi-cloud environments to reduce the risks of a single point of failure and overdependence on a single company. However, many of their resources are wasted due to inefficiencies in cost management with the pay-as-you-go approach, mismanagement of different providers, and lack of optimization affecting businesses' privacy and governance.

[DeStor](https://destor.com/the-state-of-destor-2024) says decentralized storage (DePin) is increasingly being evaluated as a viable alternative solution for hybrid and multi-cloud implementation. The jointly developed [solution between Google and Filecoin](../../getting-started/get-wallets.md) proves this trend. Indeed, DePin solutions bring many advantages, such as strong geographical coverage, no single point of failure, and higher privacy and governance for certain use cases. \

Yet even Web3 companies are limiting their integration, citing the complexity of integrations, poor quality of service (QoS), compliance concerns, unprofitable storage operators, and slow retrieval speeds as reasons for making it suitable only for cold storage.&#x20;

:rocket: **The main challenges remain unprofitable storage operators and the slow retrieval speeds of existing storage DePin solutions**.&#x20;

Additionally, traditional businesses' mass adoption of Web3 technologieswill only be possible by balancing the innovation of storage DePin and the experience of existing public cloud providers.
