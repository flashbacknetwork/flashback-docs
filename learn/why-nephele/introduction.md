# ðŸš« The Problem

AI, Web3, and other data-heavy applications fuel a surge in demand for cloud storage, a $180B market driven by the need for hot data storage. The current market is dominated by major centralized players, which are expensive and result in AI and Web3 companies having high cybersecurity expenses to manage single points of failure. This leaves companies [open to hacking](https://protos.com/users-of-hacked-mixin-network-question-projects-decentralized-nature/), limits users' control over the data ecosystems they contribute to, and highlights millions of businesses' dependency on just a few providers. Hence, according to [Deloitte Insights](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/cybersecurity-maturity-financial-institutions-cyber-risk.html), companies allocate **10.9% of their IT budgets to cybersecurity**, yet vulnerabilities persist. These centralized processes make it challenging for companies to estimate the risk and weaken their governance.&#x20;

A first alternative Due to a lack of trust in centralized cloud providers, **93% of organizations use a multi-cloud strategy**, and **87% combine public and private clouds in hybrid environments**. \
This approach has [advantages and challenges](../../learn-more/depin-and-cloud-storage/market-trends/). A [Flexera's report](https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud?lead_source=Organic%20Search) says **around 30% of cloud spending is wasted** due to inefficiencies in cost management with the pay-as-you-go approach, mismanagement of different providers, and lack of optimization affecting the users' experience of businesses.

Decentralized storage (DePin) became a viable alternative, with **62% of IT decision-makers** finding it reliable or more reliable than traditional cloud solutions, according to [DeStor](https://destor.com/the-state-of-destor-2024). Yet, **72% are not using DePin solutions**, citing the complexity of integrations, poor quality of service (QoS), compliance concerns, unprofitable storage operators, and slow retrieval speeds, making it suitable only for cold storage.
