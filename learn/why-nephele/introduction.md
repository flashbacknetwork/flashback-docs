# ðŸš« The Problem

AI, Web3, and other data-heavy applications fuel a surge in demand for cloud storage, a $300B market driven by the need for hot data storage and computing. The current market is dominated by major centralized players, which are expensive and result in AI and Web3 companies having high cybersecurity expenses to manage single points of failure. This leaves companies [open to hacking](https://protos.com/users-of-hacked-mixin-network-question-projects-decentralized-nature/), limits users' control over the data ecosystems they contribute to, and highlights millions of businesses' dependency on just a few providers.

Businesses have decided to develop hybrid and multi-cloud environments to reduce the risks of a single point of failure and overdependence on a single company. However, many of their resources are wasted due to inefficiencies in cost management with the pay-as-you-go approach, mismanagement of different providers, and lack of optimization affecting businesses' privacy and governance.

[DeStor](https://destor.com/the-state-of-destor-2024) says decentralized storage (DePin) is increasingly being evaluated as a viable alternative solution for hybrid and multi-cloud implementation. The jointly developed [solution between Google and Filecoin](../../getting-started/get-wallets.md) proves this trend. Indeed, DePin solutions bring many advantages, such as strong geographical coverage, no single point of failure, and higher privacy and governance for certain use cases. \

Yet even Web3 companies are limiting their integration, citing the complexity of integrations, poor quality of service (QoS), compliance concerns, unprofitable storage and computing operators, and slow retrieval speeds as reasons for making it suitable only for cold storage and high-latency computing.&#x20;

While the main challenges remain, solutions like ZÃ¼s or Hivenet emerges with solid foundations.&#x20;

Today, the main problem remains the adoption of these technologies offering a complex technological stacks that engineers did not learn or already attached to the traditional approaches.&#x20;

:warning: **The problem is that there is no solution bridging the gap between the user experience of centralized Cloud technologies and the security, privacy, and distribution of DePin providers.**

Traditional businesses' mass adoption of Web3 technologies will only be possible by balancing the innovation of storage DePin and the experience of existing public cloud providers.
