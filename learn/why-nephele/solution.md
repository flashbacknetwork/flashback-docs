# Solution

Flashback, our innovative DePIN-based Cloud Storage for AI, web3 Gaming, Metaverse, and other innovative services, solves the poor user experience that plagues traditional DePIN storage solutions. It offers a competitive decentralized alternative to Big Tech solutions in the $108 billion cloud data storage market, setting itself apart with its unique features and benefits.

The solution is based on 3 principles:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Quality-based profitability**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">:</mark> The storage infrastructure providers are the cornerstone of a DePIN solution. Unfortunately, many projects prefer developing a solution related to a marketing strategy rather than meeting operators' demands. They develop modular blockchain solutions instead of ensuring the storage infrastructure providers benefit from the whole ecosystem. Flashback's storage provider will also be a node to support the best security and decentralization and an on-chain storage marketplace where every validator will activate their contribution to the storage and define their operating fees.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**File transfer speed**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">:</mark> The Web3 service running with a DePIN solution must benefit from an optimal quality of storage providers. The competitors focus on growing the storage capacity provided to the network but create an unbalanced reward model. The storage providers must optimize their data availability; the only approach is incentivizing it and slashing the bad actors. Flashback allows storage providers to collect operating fees if one of its validators is the best answer to data requests from a network user's file.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Storage flexibility and interoperability**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">:</mark> Data storage must be easily integrated into traditional services or dApps. However, these projects support a unique protocol, IPFS, which reduces the freedom of developers and businesses to stick with their clients' specifications. Flashback is a unique solution that is protocol-agnostic for file transfers with its network and offers off-chain operations to support the governance and compliance required by regional laws.

Flashback provides the foundation for the competitiveness and adoption of all the web services and applications connected to its blockchain and different layers.
