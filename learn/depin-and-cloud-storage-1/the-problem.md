# The Problem

Despite their extraordinary impact on cloud storage, the Web3 ecosystem has yet to embrace them fully, with even the most extensive network, Filecoin, being utilized at only 1% of its capacity by the end of 2022 (see [here](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-state-of-decentralized-storage)). This is mainly because of the technical limitations of the existing solutions focusing on archives.

Despite their significant potential, DePIN solutions remain relatively scarce, and where they do exist, thereâ€™s much room for improvement in quality and user experience. Most data stored in centralized solutions is often non-permanent or for intensively demanding applications like Artificial Intelligence (AI), data-driven market analysis, or video games.

Hence, many Web3 companies (90% of them representing a loss of $1b in 2023 for the web3 ecosystem) still rely on centralized providers like Google or Amazon, primarily due to the inefficiency and high costs associated with decentralized options. This reliance presents substantial trust and security concerns, but **the problem is the lack of competitiveness of web3 service providers against the web2 solutions in their market segment.**

## The unsolved key challenges of DePIN-based Cloud Storage

### Profitability and file transfer speed

The existing solutions need to offer a suitable economy model to support diverse infrastructure providers while ensuring the services have the best quality hardware provided to the network.

_Filecoin, Arweave, and Crust_ use the storage power principle, respectively. They encourage the storage providers to offer the network the most significant data storage capacity and large amounts of data to win block rewards. This leads to the impoverishment of network quality and decentralization of low-quality equipment that is massively connected in a few nodes. It decreases the file download speed. The protocols intend this because they focus on archives, but as we exposed earlier, they need to meet the world's needs.

_Flux, AIOZ, or Storj (and_ deploying centralized systems (limited number of validators or permission-based storage providing system), guaranteeing a good file download speed. The profitability of the storage providers (and the right to participate) depends on an entity that is against the permissionless principle of web3.

Siacoin has storage fees explicitly set up by storage providers in an on-chain marketplace. This feature is the best scenario for diverse hardware quality in the network, as it ensures no unfair competition by design. Siacoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm for the block validation consensus. This means a storage provider must spend considerable money to benefit directly from the network valuation. Additionally, there is no incentive mechanism to support faster file download speed by the storage providers.

### Utilization and Adoption

A 2022 Coingecko report highlighted that Filecoin was operating at just 1% of its capacity, with revenues from all decentralized solutions representing only 0.1% of AWS's revenues. At this time, the market capitalization of DePIN solutions was around $5b. Did it change?

In June 2024, the emergence of the DePIN trend and the development of blockchain solutions for Cloud storage improved the situation. The market capitalization of DePIN solutions reached the symbolic value of $20b. Filecoin is now used at 22% of its capacity, according to [Messari](https://messari.io/report/state-of-filecoin-q1-2024), but the available storage capacity dropped from 22,000 to 8,100 Petabytes (PB) because of the lack of utilization and profitability. Messari reports a [surge in usage ](https://messari.io/report/state-of-sia-q1-2024)of Siacoin, but the storage used is around 1,900 PB.

We are from the 500,000,000 PB supported by Google only.

The storage providers are fleeing from the DePIN solutions, forcing the new solution to imagine the best scenario, which was building private and centralized solutions. The Web3 companies would only trust the fully decentralized public blockchain, and less than 10% use a Web3 cloud solution sticking with this, citing complex networks, poor profitability, and inadequate user experience as primary barriers.

Projects are pushing hard for lower costs, but the experience with these solutions is primarily criticized for the slow transfer speed because they rely on public IPFS. A solution is to develop a private IPFS, which leads to extensive infrastructure costs for the project or the service, creates centralized storage that no one wants, and forces the developers to learn new frameworks. Then, developers face steep learning curves, and businesses need help integrating these solutions into existing processes.

### Data Compliance and Sovereignty

Legal entities claim more privacy and respect for companies' sovereignty in data management and accessibility. DePIN-based cloud storage is the perfect future for the current legal concerns of experts, companies, and individuals.

Unfortunately, DePIN projects decided to respect their network's data compliance and sovereignty by centralizing the rewards and economy in the hands of trusted actors in their ecosystem. This creates an unfair ecosystem for users because it is antinomic to Satoshi's vision of decentralized and public blockchain networks. Finally, this gives the network jurisdiction in certain regions' hands, reducing the governance of businesses in the other areas of the world.

Another major problem with the existing solutions is that they force Web3 services to use specific file transfer protocols like IPFS, Tardigrade, or the Arweave protocol. While highly secure and private, these protocols do not allow Web3 services to manage their service performances, and companies can't control where and how the data is stored in the different nodes of the network.

The companies must then be able to choose their protocols, the nodes they want to use, and what to pay, which is the standard framework of the Data Act in the United States, Europe, China, and other regions of the world. Indeed, certain applications, like healthcare, require rigorous data traceability and storage localization.
