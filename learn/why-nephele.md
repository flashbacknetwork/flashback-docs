# ðŸ“¸ Why Flashback?

The problem with current DePIN-based cloud storage is the exact condition of the slow adoption of Web3 technologies. If a Web3 business or application pays the costs of centralized giant companies, then it can't outperform the centralized competitors.

Flashback, our innovative DePIN-based Cloud Storage for AI, web3 Gaming, Metaverse, and other innovative services, solves the poor user experience that plagues traditional DePIN storage solutions. It offers a competitive decentralized alternative to Big Tech solutions in the $108 billion cloud data storage market, setting itself apart with its unique features and benefits.

The solution is based on 3 principles:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Quality-based profitability**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">:</mark> The storage infrastructure providers are the cornerstone of a DePIN solution. Unfortunately, many projects prefer developing a solution related to a marketing strategy rather than meeting operators' demands. They develop modular blockchain solutions instead of ensuring the storage infrastructure providers benefit from the whole ecosystem. Flashback's storage provider will also be a node to support the best security and decentralization and an on-chain storage marketplace where every validator will activate their contribution to the storage and define their operating fees.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**File transfer speed**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">:</mark> The Web3 service running with a DePIN solution must benefit from an optimal quality of storage providers. The competitors focus on growing the storage capacity provided to the network but create an unbalanced reward model. The storage providers must optimize their data availability; the only approach is incentivizing it and slashing the bad actors. Flashback allows storage providers to collect operating fees if one of its validators is the best answer to data requests from a network user's file.
* <mark style="color:yellow;">**Storage flexibility**</mark><mark style="color:yellow;">:</mark> Data storage must be easily integrated into traditional services or dApps. However, these projects support a unique protocol, IPFS, which reduces the freedom of developers and businesses to stick with their clients' specifications. Flashback is a unique solution that is protocol-agnostic for file transfers with its network and offers off-chain operations to support the governance and compliance required by the regional laws.

Flashback provides the foundation for the competitiveness and adoption of all the web services and applications connected to its blockchain and different layers.

## **Flashback Compliance System**

To navigate the diverse regulatory landscapes, Flashback will develop and sustain a federated compliance system, which will be centrally verified and upheld with the cooperation of local regulatory bodies. This arrangement allows developers to create various applications that operate on different network segments, each conforming to specific regulatory requirements, by selecting network compliance lists at the protocol level.

<mark style="color:yellow;">It's crucial to recognize that these compliance lists do not impose censorship; developers retain the freedom to utilize any validators or service gateway, especially when building projects without specific compliance needs.</mark> Nevertheless, regulatory entities can publicly and transparently identify the file storage and service gateway providers that meet compliance standards, offering greater traceability and interoperability akin to conventional centralized cloud solutions. The Flashback Compliance System, with its transparent processes, will leverage data from validators and file storage contracts (among other components) using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and contemporary tools to foster the networkâ€™s evolution dynamically, pinpoint potential non-compliant nodes, and efficiently refresh the list in collaboration with regulatory authorities.

This innovative system ensures that while Flashback embraces decentralization, it also remains adaptable and compliant with global data protection standards, balancing the benefits of decentralized storage with the necessities of legal compliance.
