# Quality-of-Network (QoN) Optimizer

The Quality-of-Network (QoN) Optimizer is a smart contract designed for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain networks. It is intended to optimize data availability and integrity through a decentralized network of validators. This document outlines the technical specifications of the QoN Optimizer, which leverages Proofs of Space-Time (PoST) within the Dencun data availability layer to ensure secure and efficient data transactions. The QoN Optimizer utilizes a contract-based mechanism where validators are required to store and reliably provide data upon request. Validators submit PoST to demonstrate they have held a specific amount of data for a designated period. The system is designed to incentivize speed and reliability among validators by providing economic rewards and penalties.

## Contract Specifications

**1. User Contract Deployment**

* **Parameters**:
  * `x`: Number of validator nodes.
  * `y`: Duration for which the contract is active.
* **Parameters Initialization**: Upon deployment, the contract initializes with predefined durations of data storage for registration and operation, and contract fee corresponding to the sum of the fees for the selected validators.
* **Functionality**:
  * A user deploys the QoN Optimizer contract by specifying the desired number of validator nodes and the contract duration.
  * Validators are then able to join the contract by registering themselves and proving their capacity to store data.
* **State Variables**:
  * `registrationEndTime`: Timestamp indicating the end of the validator registration period.
  * `contractEndTime`: Timestamp when the contract ceases to accept data requests.
  * `minimumFee`: Staked amount required for a node to participate as a validator.

**2. Validator Contract Management and Duties**

* **Registration**: When a contract is submitted, validators register by sending a transaction (a collatoral) including a fee. The contract records each validatorâ€™s commitment and capabilities.
* **Data Handling Responsibilities**: After registration, validators respond to data requests from users, proving delivery through cryptographic signatures linked to the off-chain PoST verification.

**3 Data Requests**

* **Trigger**:
  * Users can request the data stored by the validators at any point during the contract duration.
* **Process**:
  * Users send a data request transaction on-chain, specifying which data they wish to access.
  * This transaction is visible to all participating validators.

**4. Validator Data Provision**

* **Data Provision and Verification**: Validators fetch the requested data and provide it back to the requester along with a response time and a signature.
* **Responsibility**:
  * Upon receiving a data request, validators are required to send the requested file directly to the user.
* **Verification**:
  * Validators must ensure that the data sent is accurate and complete, adhering to the terms specified in the contract.

**5. User Proof of Space-Time (PoST) Commitment**

* **Generation**:
  * Once the user receives the file, they must generate a PoST to verify receipt and integrity of the data.
* **Submission**:
  * The PoST is then submitted to a blob on the Dencun data availability layer.
* **Purpose**:
  * This proof serves as a verifiable claim that the user has indeed received the data as per the request.

**6. Performance-Based Reward Assessment and Distribution**

* **Criteria**:
  * Throughout the duration of the contract, the performance of validators is monitored based on the average time taken to fulfill data requests.
* **Reward Mechanism**:
  * The validator with the quickest average response time throughout the contract can receive its data storage fee and a rebate of half the remaining contract fee.
  * The validator(s) with a lower average response time throughout the contract is/are eligible for a rebate amounting to half the _**post-winner fee**_ (remaining contract fee after the winner's payment) divided by the number of validator(s).
* **Security Measure**:
  * **Half of the post-winner fee** is irrevocably burnt to prevent fraudulent behavior, such as validators exchanging files among themselves to claim rebates.

## Security Considerations

* **Proof of Space-Time**:
  * The PoST mechanism is crucial for preventing Sybil attacks and ensuring validators hold the data they claim to manage.
* **Economic Incentives**:
  * The system discourages malicious practices and promotes genuine service provision by burning half of the post-winner fees and rewarding only the most efficient validator.
* **Data Integrity**:
  * The requirement for users to validate received data through PoST ensures data integrity and deters validators from sending incorrect or incomplete files.
