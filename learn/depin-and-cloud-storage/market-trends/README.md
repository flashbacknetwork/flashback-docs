# Trends

One of the most significant trends in cloud storage is the increasing adoption of hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Organizations no longer rely solely on a single cloud provider but instead, combine services from multiple providers to optimize their storage strategies. Hybrid clouds offer the flexibility to use both on-premises and cloud-based resources, while multi-cloud setups leverage services from various cloud vendors to avoid vendor lock-in and enhance resilience.

This approach allows businesses to balance cost, performance, and security needs more effectively. It also allows enterprises to scale resources based on specific requirements and manage different workloads more efficiently. As enterprises seek agility and flexibility, the hybrid and multi-cloud trend is expected to gain even more momentum.
