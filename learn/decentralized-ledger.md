# Flashback Network

Flashback is a Layer-1 blockchain network that merges the robust features of Ethereum's smart contract platform with Filecoin's decentralized storage capabilities, creating a unique ecosystem designed for decentralized, scalable, and secure data storage solutions. By leveraging Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus for security and Filecoin’s Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt) for data verification, Flashback aims to offer efficient, high-performance cloud storage without the centralization and cost drawbacks typical in traditional cloud services.
