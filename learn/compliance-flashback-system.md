# Compliance Flashback System

To navigate the diverse regulatory landscapes, Flashback will develop and sustain a federated compliance system, which will be centrally verified and upheld with the cooperation of local regulatory bodies. This arrangement allows developers to create various applications that operate on different network segments, each conforming to specific regulatory requirements, by selecting network compliance lists at the protocol level.

It's crucial to recognize that these compliance lists do not impose any form of censorship; developers retain the freedom to utilize any validators or service gateway, especially when building projects without specific compliance needs. Nevertheless, regulatory entities can publicly and transparently identify the file storage providers (and their validators) and service gateway providers that meet compliance standards, offering greater traceability and interoperability akin to conventional centralized cloud solutions. This Compliance Flashback System, with its transparent processes, will leverage data from validators and file storage contracts (among other components) using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and contemporary tools to dynamically foster the networkâ€™s evolution, pinpoint potential non-compliant nodes, and efficiently refresh the list in collaboration with regulatory authorities.
