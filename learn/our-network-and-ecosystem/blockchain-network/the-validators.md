# The Validators

The proof-of-stake spacetime (PoS-ST) has different responsibilities as validators. The validators are primarily staking-based, equivalent to Ethereum's validators. A validator stores data processes transactions and adds new blocks to the blockchain. However, the storage duties are limited to on-chain data storage. &#x20;

The validators can decide to be storage providers by enabling the proof-of-spacetime (PoSt) commitments as validators. This way, you extend your duties with off-chain file storage, the cornerstone of our DePIN-based cloud storage.

## The Benefits of Being Validators

### Earn rewards

Rewards are given for activities that help keep the network secure and running smoothly. You'll earn staking rewards for running Nephele software that groups transactions into new blocks and verifies the work of others. This is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the chain.

### Better security

The network becomes more secure against attacks as more NEPH is staked. This is because controlling most of the network would require owning most of all staked NEPH. Essentially, the more NEPH staked, the harder it is for anyone to gain enough control to pose a threat.

### Sustainable&#x20;

Doing staking is the best way to consume limited resources at the opposite of the proof-of-work and other protocols. While data stoega
