# Decentralized Ledger

In 2008, the subprime crisis caused severe damage to the world, leading to years of depression. The trust in banks and centralized financial authorities led to the imagination of new approaches to supporting this trust by machines. \

A group of persons or an individual (who knows) called [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) decided to adopt the blockchain with a public and open-source peer-to-peer network of computers. The mission is to propose an alternative decentralized financial system where a machine-based consensus certifies the cryptographic mechanisms and the alteration of the blockchain without the need for a trusted third party.

The decentralized ledger was born with its first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, to incentivize the owners of machines to participate positively in the consensus based on the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm. Bitcoin enables it to operate accountancy operations called transactions of its cryptocurrency. Nowadays, the Bitcoin network is in the category of Layer-1 blockchain, like Ethereum, Solana, or **Nephele**. It has the following characteristics:

1. _Decentralized Ledger:_ The network maintains a distributed ledger that records all transactions and state changes. The machines in the peer-to-peer network maintaining the ledger are called network nodes or **nodes**.
2. _Consensus Mechanism:_ Layer-1 blockchains implement consensus protocols (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof-of-Stake-Spacetime) that allow nodes to agree on the state of the blockchain and validate transactions. These nodes performing the consensus process are called **validators**.
3. _Native Cryptocurrency:_ Most Layer-1 blockchains have a native cryptocurrency used for transactions and incentivizing network participants. Nephele supports its cryptocurrency called **NEPH**.
4. _Smart Contract Functionality:_ Some Layer-1 blockchains support smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into the code. **Nephele is EVM-compatible by fork**, which means it has the same features of virtual machines as Ethereum.

Layer-1 blockchains are critical, forming the foundation for other solutions and enhancements (like Layer-2 protocols). They provide the essential infrastructure for the operation and security of the entire blockchain ecosystem, enabling various applications from digital currencies to complex decentralized applications.
