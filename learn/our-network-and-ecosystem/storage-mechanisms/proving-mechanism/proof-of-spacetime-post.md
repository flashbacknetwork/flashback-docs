# Availability Verification (PoSt)

**Proof of Spacetime (PoSt)** is a fundamental concept within several blockchain protocols, prominently used in Filecoin. It is designed to ensure that data stored by a network participant is kept over a specified period. This cryptographic proof is crucial for decentralized storage solutions, where it's necessary to verify that storage providers continuously and correctly store the data they've committed to holding.&#x20;
