# Sector: The Storage Unit

In the Filecoin network, a "sector" is a key storage unit that storage providers use to store data on behalf of clients. Sectors come in standardized sizes, such as 32 GiB or 64 GiB, and represent the amount of storage space allocated for storing client data. To use a sector for storage, providers undergo a process called "sealing," which involves encoding the data to prove the provider is storing it uniquely. This process, known as Proof-of-Replication (PoRep), generates cryptographic proofs to verify that data has been securely and uniquely stored within the sector.

Sectors are crucial for enabling storage deals on the Filecoin network, where storage providers enter into contracts with clients to store their data for a specified period. Each sector can be dedicated to a single storage deal or shared among multiple deals, depending on its size and configuration. Once data is sealed and stored in a sector, storage providers must periodically submit cryptographic proofs called Proofs of Spacetime (PoSt) to demonstrate that they continue to store the data reliably over time. A sector's lifecycle includes pledging, sealing, storing data during the agreed term, and, eventually, being either reused or removed after the contract expires.
