# File Storage Deals

The deal and sectors are unitary elements that compose the Filecoin network. The Flashback network derives these components to support the data storage security.

## Deal: A file Storage Contract with the Network

In the Filecoin network, a "deal" refers to an agreement between a client and a storage provider. Essentially, this deal is a contract where the client pays the storage provider to keep their files securely on the network for a specified duration. The storage provider allocates space within its systems to house the client's data, ensuring its safety and availability as agreed upon in the terms of the deal.

### **Overview**

A file storage contract in the Filecoin network can be compared to a traditional service level agreement (SLA) in conventional cloud storage services but is enforced by blockchain technology. Here's how it typically works between a network client and a storage provider (it can be extended to multiple storage providers):

1. **Making a Deal:**
   * The client selects a storage provider and proposes a deal.
   * The deal proposal includes details such as the required storage size, duration, and price willing to be paid.
2. **Acceptance and Storage:**
   * If the storage provider agrees to the terms, they accept the deal.
   * The client then sends their data to the storage provider.
   * The provider stores the data and must periodically prove to the network that they are correctly storing it through cryptographic proofs.
3. **Deal Lifecycle:**
   * Deals in Filecoin are immutably recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent and verifiable record of the agreement and its fulfillment.
   * Storage providers receive compensation in Filecoin tokens, which are disbursed according to the contract terms, typically after they successfully prove they are holding the data as agreed.
   * The minimum duration for these deals is 180 days, while the maximum extends to 540 days, balancing deal length with cryptographic security needs.
4. **Proofs of Storage:**
   * Throughout the deal, the storage provider must submit proof to the blockchain. These proofs, known as Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt), verify that the data is correctly stored over time.
5. **Deal Completion:**
   * Upon completion of the deal term, the client can retrieve the data, or the deal can be renewed or extended.

Using smart contracts for these deals adds a layer of security and automation, reducing the potential for disputes and ensuring compliance with the agreed terms without requiring intermediaries.

The structure of Filecoinâ€™s storage deals leverages blockchain technology to provide a decentralized, reliable service. This method democratizes access to data storage and enhances data sovereignty by giving clients control over their storage terms and conditions without relying on centralized entities.
