# From Ethereum

Flashback is a Layer-1 blockchain as an Ethereum fork. We ultimately inherit its blockchain architecture. Our comprehensive documentation covers all the primary information needed to understand the network features and how to join our ecosystem. You can discover more about Ethereum [here](https://ethereum.org/en/).&#x20;

However, the Ethereum documentation has had many ramifications over the last 10 years and can be complex to read. It is why we reworked it in our documentation to ease your experience.&#x20;
