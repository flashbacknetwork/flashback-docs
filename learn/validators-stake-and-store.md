# Validators: Stake + Store

The proof-of-stake spacetime (PoS-ST) has different responsibilities as validators. Validators are primarily staking-based, equivalent to Ethereum's validators, which are [full nodes](our-network-and-ecosystem/ethereum-stack-in-nephele/basics/nodes-and-clients-1.md). A validator stores data processes transactions and adds new blocks to the blockchain. However, storage duties are limited to on-chain data storage.

The validators can decide to be storage providers by enabling the proof-of-spacetime (PoSt) commitments as validators. This way, you extend your duties with off-chain file storage, the cornerstone of our DePIN-based cloud storage.

## Why be a validator?

### Earn rewards and Be Profitable

Rewards are given for activities that help keep the network secure and running smoothly. You'll earn staking rewards for running Nephele software that groups transactions into new blocks and verifies the work of others. This is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the chain.

A validator can decide to participate in the file storage duties by allowing the commitment of storage proofs. After setting your parameters and operating fees (what people must pay to store files in your validator), you'll earn rewards according to your performances assessed by the [quality-of-network (QoN) optimizer](quality-of-network-qon-optimizer.md). You will participate in the diversity of storage offers and be a founder of the mass adoption of innovative use cases in the web3 ecosystem. With our novel [proof](consensus-proof-of-stake-spacetime.md), you can also parametrize as you want the storage duties and how you want to commit them to the network. This unique flexibility will allow you to develop a business model with your storage and be competitive. You'll have the best profitability of your storage space.

### Secure the network and Improve the Privacy

As more NEPH is staked, the network becomes more secure against attacks. This is because controlling most of the network would require owning the most staked NEPH. Essentially, the more NEPH staked, the harder it is for anyone to gain enough control to pose a threat. You will be a cornerstone of the security and decentralization of the network.

If you enable file storage, you can participate in the cloud storage layer and improve the network's security, privacy, and value. You will be the precursor of a fairer and competitive world where every individual and business can store their files according to their requirements.

### Participate in a Sustainable Ecosystem

Doing staking is the best way to consume limited resources, the opposite of the proof-of-work or proof-of-capacity-based systems. This is why Nephele used the staking model to avoid a frantic race for the power of block validation.

Nephele chose to develop a sustainable ecosystem by design. You'll be part of decision processes toward greener and more sustainable cloud storage by offering and optimizing our operating fees depending on your energy consumption, workforce, and other criteria.

## How to become a Validator?

There are 3 different ways to become a validator:

* **Solo Validator**: This is the ultimate standard. You have full participation rewards, you improve the decentralization of the network, and you never require trusting anyone else with your funds. You'll need a dedicated computer connected to the Internet. This connection must be stable and available \~24/7.

\---- (to add the following)

#### Staking-as-a-Service

* **Your 32 FLASH**: Start with your stake.
* **Your Validator Keys**: Manage your credentials.
* **Entrusted Node Operation**: Leave the technicalities to the experts.

If you're hesitant about managing hardware but still want to stake your 32 FLASH, consider using staking-as-a-service. This option guides you through the process of creating validator credentials, uploading your signing keys, and depositing your 32 FLASH. The service handles validation on your behalf, allowing you to earn native block rewards.

This method requires trusting the service provider. To mitigate risk, withdrawal keys—allowing you to reclaim your FLASH—are typically retained by you, ensuring security and control.

#### Pooled Staking

* **Stake Any Amount**: Flexible entry.
* **Earn Rewards**: Participate in gains.
* **Keep it Simple**: User-friendly approach.
* **Popular Choice**: Widely used option.

For those not ready or able to stake 32 FLASH directly, pooled staking offers a viable alternative. Many services offer what's known as 'liquid staking', which issues an ERC-20 liquidity token that represents your staked FLASH. This makes it easy to enter or exit staking positions just like a token swap and allows you to maintain custody of your assets in your own Flashback wallet.

Keep in mind, pooled staking solutions are developed by third parties and are not native to the Flashback network. These platforms introduce their own set of risks.

Both of these staking methods provide ways to engage with the Flashback ecosystem, whether you prefer a hands-on approach or seek the simplicity and lower entry requirements of pooled options.
