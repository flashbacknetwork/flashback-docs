# Account Actor

**Account Actors** in Filecoin are fundamental entities representing **user accounts** on the Filecoin blockchain. These actors are responsible for managing the state and operations associated with a user’s **FIL balance**, including **sending and receiving FIL tokens**, **interacting with other actors** (such as storage providers and market actors), and **signing transactions**.

## **Technical Overview**

* **Built-in Actor:**\
  Account Actors are one of the **built-in actors** in the Filecoin protocol, defined as part of the core protocol specifications. They are implemented in Filecoin clients like **Lotus** and other compatible clients.
* **Smart Contract-Like Functionality:**\
  While not smart contracts in the traditional sense, Account Actors manage the state and logic associated with user accounts, acting as a foundational smart contract for user operations.
* **Secure and Immutable State Management:**\
  Account Actors use cryptographic principles to ensure secure state management. The immutability of blockchain ensures that account states are tamper-proof and transparent.

#### **Summary:**

**Account Actors** in Filecoin are essential components that represent user accounts and manage their FIL balances, transactions, and interactions with other actors on the network. They are responsible for signing transactions, managing locked and available balances, interacting with smart contracts, and paying gas fees for network operations. As foundational entities in the Filecoin ecosystem, Account Actors enable users to securely participate in decentralized storage, deal-making, and network governance.
