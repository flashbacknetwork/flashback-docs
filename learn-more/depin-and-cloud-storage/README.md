# ☁️ Centralized Cloud Storage

The world is becoming increasingly numeric, where data is its fuel. As fuel, it must be stored and distributed. The emergence of the internet and subsequent services have enabled people to effortlessly communicate, share, and store their information and data with their families, friends, governments, and other entities.

This massive data storage makes up the foundation of Big Data—a phenomenon aimed at enhancing the quality of services and user experience through analyzing large-scale datasets or training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These new technologies brought the emergence of new applications in the supply chain, healthcare, and language inference. The data storage market made over $180 billion in revenues in 2023, and the simulation evaluates this market to be over $700 billion in 2032. (see [here](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-storage-market-102991)) Today, everyone has a mobile phone with diverse applications, which densifies the stratum of interaction in the numeric world.

Managing and storing such large amounts of data requires an enormous computer science infrastructure. Cloud data storage has quickly become the go-to solution for companies because of the increasing number of data breaches associated with traditional and local storage solutions, their lack of accessibility worldwide, the interoperability issues, and the deployment costs of establishing new infrastructure.
