# The Rise of Decentralized Storage

The world is becoming increasingly numeric, where data is its fuel. The emergence of the internet and subsequent services have enabled people to effortlessly communicate, share, and store their information and data with their families, friends, governments, and other entities.&#x20;

This massive data storage makes up the foundation of Big Dataâ€”a phenomenon aimed at enhancing the quality of services and user experience through analyzing large-scale datasets or training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These new technologies brought the emergence of new applications in the supply chain, healthcare, and language inference. The data storage market made over $180 billion in revenues in 2023, and the simulation evaluates this market to be over $700 billion in 2032. (see [here](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-storage-market-102991)) Today, everyone has a mobile phone with diverse applications, which densifies the stratum of interaction in the numeric world.&#x20;

Managing and storing such large amounts of data requires an enormous infrastructure in computer science. Cloud data storage has quickly become the go-to solution companies use because of the increasing number of data breaches associated with traditional and local storage solutions, their lack of accessibility worldwide, the interoperability issues, and the deployment costs of establishing new infrastructure.

### The Dawn of Cloud storage with centralized operators

Whereas personal computers were the best data storage medium in the 80s, the need for faster data transfer rates and more efficient storage solutions propelled the adoption of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) via the Internet as time progressed. At the end of the '90s, large IT firms imagined creating a distributed network globally to provide total accessibility to its data. This gives the foundation for integrating streaming platforms and social media into our daily lives.&#x20;

This new generation of data storage is dominating the data storage market segment, with a total revenue of $99.2 billion in 2023. The cloud data storage market emerged, featuring companies such as Google, Amazon Web Services, Baidu, and Microsoft, now leaders in the industry.

Centralizing and consolidating power among these major companies has led to many concerns regarding data privacy, legal compliance, and data governance, particularly in Europe. Furthermore, the escalating number of data breaches each year demonstrates the growing vulnerability in centralized solutions, reflecting increasing interest among hackers. Moreover, centralized solutions can potentially subject data to foreign censorship, compromise privacy by sharing foreign customers' data, or increase storage fees, which doubled from 2018 to 2023.

### The New Hope: Decentralized Storage

These security and data privacy concerns have resulted in various projects developing decentralized networks, often known as Decentralized Cloud, Web3 Cloud, Web3 Storage, or DePIN-based Cloud Storage. Notable projects in this domain include Filecoin and Arweave. However, despite their recognition, the Web3 ecosystem has yet to embrace them fully, with even the most extensive network, Filecoin, being utilized at only 1% of its capacity by the end of 2022 (see [here](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-state-of-decentralized-storage)). This underutilization stems from fundamental issues explained in Section II, resulting in a poor application user experience.
