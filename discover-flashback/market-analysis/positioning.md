# Positioning

To better understand where **Flashback** fits in the cloud ecosystem, here’s a breakdown of major three **cloud solution categories.**

***

## :control\_knobs: **Centralized Cloud Providers**&#x20;

Centralized cloud providers offer on-demand storage resources. They own and operate **massive data centers** worldwide, allowing businesses to deploy and scale applications globally.

| ✅Pros                                     | ❌Cons                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| High performance and reliability          | Vendor lock-in & high costs                                  |
| Fully managed services with automation    | Data privacy concerns (government access, regulatory issues) |
| Strong enterprise security and compliance | Limited interoperability between providers                   |

***

## :desktop: **Decentralized Cloud Providers**

Decentralized cloud solutions operate **peer-to-peer**, using blockchain to **distribute storage tasks** across independent nodes. Instead of a single entity owning the infrastructure, individual participants rent out computing/storage resources.

| ✅Pros                                         | ❌Cons                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Privacy-first and censorship-resistant        | Performance and availability depend on network participants |
| Lower costs due to marketplace-driven pricing | Less mature ecosystem than centralized clouds               |
| No single point of failure                    | Limited enterprise adoption                                 |

## :musical\_score: **Multi-Cloud Orchestrators**

Multi-cloud orchestrators **abstract cloud infrastructure** by allowing organizations to **deploy workloads across multiple cloud providers** (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.). These tools optimize **cost, redundancy, and scalability** without vendor lock-in.

| ✅Pros                                                        | ❌Cons                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Flexibility to run applications on different cloud providers | Still relies on centralized cloud providers          |
| Avoid vendor lock-in and optimize cloud costs                | Can be complex to implement and manage               |
| Hybrid and multi-cloud management with automation            | Cost savings depend on workload and provider pricing |

## :zap:**Flashback – Decentralized Multi-Cloud Platform**

Flashback is a **decentralized multi-cloud platform** that orchestrates peer-to-peer bridge storage with centralized and decentralized Cloud providers.

The following table presents the positioning of&#x20;

## **Comparison of Top Multi-Cloud Orchestrators with Flashback**

This table evaluates **Flashback** against leading **multi-cloud orchestrators** and includes **Google Cloud** (as a centralized cloud provider) and **Filecoin** (as a decentralized storage provider) for reference as non multi-clud providers. It gives here the ositioning of Flashback as a major technological revolution in the Cloud landscape.

## :rocket: **Why Flashback Stands Out**

✅ **Decentralized & trustless:** Use the power of smart contract technologies to support a transparent and auditable storage.\
✅ **Multi-cloud optimized:** Enables hybrid storage across centralized and decentralized clouds with a unique orchestration system developped for leveraging the best of both worlds.\
✅ **Agentic AI:** Unique platform integrating Agentic AI to optimize the costs and resource allocation with the marketplace and tools of the platform.\
✅ **Cost efficiency:** Balances **storage cost vs. retrieval speed** dynamically according to the providers or nodes' performances of DePin technologies;

Unlike **AWS, Azure, and GCP**, it eliminates **vendor lock-in** and enables **provable storage**.

Unlike **Akash, Filecoin, and Flux**, it integrates **multi-cloud orchestration**, ensuring **optimized performance** while maintaining decentralization.

Unlike **Anthos, OpenShift, and Terraform**, it doesn’t rely only on centralized cloud providers but rather **balances between decentralized and centalized environments**.
