## Prerequisites

I recommend that you read the sections:

* [Cloud Storage](../../learn-more/depin-and-cloud-storage/) presents the genesis and market of the Cloud, with an introduction to trends and future technologies integrated into data storage solutions,
* [DePIN Storage](../../learn-more/depin-and-cloud-storage-1/) explores the world of decentralized data storage technologies, with a detailed analysis of the players in this emerging and exponentially growing segment.

## Introduction

According to [Deloitte Insights](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/cybersecurity-maturity-financial-institutions-cyber-risk.html), companies allocate **10.9% of their IT budgets to cybersecurity**, yet vulnerabilities persist. These centralized processes make it challenging for companies to estimate the risk and weaken their privacy and governance.&#x20;

Due to a lack of trust in centralized cloud providers, **93% of organizations use a multi-cloud strategy**, and **87% combine public and private clouds in hybrid environments**.&#x20;

This approach has [advantages and challenges](../../learn-more/depin-and-cloud-storage/market-trends/). A Flexera report says around 30% of cloud spending is wasted due to inefficiencies in cost management with the pay-as-you-go approach, mismanagement of different providers, and lack of optimization affecting businesses' privacy and governance.

[DeStor](https://destor.com/the-state-of-destor-2024) says decentralized storage (DePin) is increasingly being evaluated for hybrid and multi-cloud implementation as a viable alternative solution for 62% of IT decision-makers. The jointly developed [solution between Google and Filecoin](../../getting-started/get-wallets.md) proves this trend.

Yet **72% are not using DePin solutions**, citing the complexity of integrations, poor quality of service (QoS), compliance concerns, unprofitable storage operators, and slow retrieval speeds, making it suitable only for cold storage.&#x20;

## Overview of Cloud Market

The data storage provider is a centralized or decentralized network that enables companies and individuals to host their data via services or applications. One service will upload a file to a server without further processing. Another provider may offer to rent servers where you will store your data, but you will not be able to compute the data on these servers.

:chart\_with\_upwards\_trend: According to [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/cloud-storage-market-102773), cloud data storage market reached:

* A value of 108.69 billion USD in 2023 with 23.4% CAGR.
* This segment will reach 472.47 billion USD by 2030, driven by the need for larger data storage capacities in use cases.&#x20;
* In 2023, users produced over 120 billion terabytes, but only 0.015% reached a centralized cloud.&#x20;
* This sector is subject to a growing number of regulations and demands for more secure, privacy-friendly solutions. This is having a major impact on centralization solutions, which are facing heavy spending on cybersecurity (a market worth over 100 billion by 2023) to attract new business.&#x20;

:chart\_with\_upwards\_trend: Another report from [Synergy Research Group](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/q1-cloud-spending-grows-by-over-10-billion-from-2022-the-big-three-account-for-65-of-the-total) offers a quick overview of enterprise dominance:

* The Cloud data storage market as a whole is worth 63 billion USD in Q1 2023, as opposed to 53 billion in Q1 2022.&#x20;
* The market is made up of various players: Amazon Web Service (32%), Microsoft Azure (23%), Google Cloud (10%), the next 20 companies (26%) and other solutions (8%).

:round\_pushpin:In 2023, we interviewed for 3 months to 100 individuals in France (lawyers, business executives, developers, or IT dorectors) with experience of a traditional cloud data storage solution. Here is some results:

* 60% were concerned about the dominance of BigTech solutions on the issue of traceability and privacy protection.&#x20;
* 92.5% of them prefer a solution from the Tech giants over other solutions because of its technical efficiency and deployment time.&#x20;
* 72.5% say DePin solutions are promising for reasons of competitiveness, traceability, interoperability, privacy and security but consider existing solutions as “not suitable”.
