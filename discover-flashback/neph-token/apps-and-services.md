## Economic Interactions with the Platform

Submitting the SLA requires paying the gas fees related to the smart contract, which will be included in the SLA fees. The SLA fees also include the general fees for the platform running costs and guarantee Flashback operations.&#x20;

There are different tiered levels, which will be defined during in future phases of network evolution. Every Tier will be based on the number of FLASH tokens the consumers will stake.&#x20;

For example, the first Tier is basic capacity with reducing SLA fees and minimal functionalities and statistics. Higher tiers will provide AI-driven tools or more functionalities. &#x20;

Here are the different fees and payments (in crypto or FLASH) from the application layer:

* **SLA Payments for Providers**: Consumers pay providers to reserve and utilize services under SLAs.  SLA payments vary based on storage/compute amount, contract duration, provider, redundancy, QoS, and other parameters.
* **Platform Operational Fees**: SLA fees, including the smart contract gas fees, also cover platform running costs to sustain Flashbackâ€™s operations, such as the marketplace and other advantages related to Flashback.
* **Tiered-based staking plans**: Consumers can select different tiered plans with different options and advantages. The initial plan will offer limited access to the platform, such as a lower priority to commit to SLAs. At the same time, greater tiers will give more flexibility and possibilities with the platform, such as high-priority commitment SLAs and AI-driven tools for pricing and provider selections.&#x20;
