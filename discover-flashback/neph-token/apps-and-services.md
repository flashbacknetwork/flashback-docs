## Economic Interactions with the Platform

Submitting the SLA requires paying the gas fees related to the smart contract, which will be included in the SLA fees. The SLA fees also include the general fees for the platform running costs and guarantee Flashback operations.&#x20;

The solutions in the application layer can be subscribed to different tiered levels, which will be defined during the testnet phase. The first Tier is basic storage capacity without paying the SLA fees with minimal functionalities, such as a certain range of providers and solutions. Higher tiers will provide AI-driven tools or more functionalities. &#x20;

Here are the different fees and payments (in fiat or cryptocurrency) from the application layer:

* **SLA Payments for Storage Providers**: Consumers pay storage providers to reserve and utilize storage services under SLAs.  SLA payments vary based on storage amount, contract duration, provider, redundancy, QoS, and other parameters.
* **Platform Operational Fees**: SLA fees, including the smart contract gas fees, also cover platform running costs to sustain Flashbackâ€™s operations, such as the marketplace and other advantages related to Flashback.
* **Platform Options**: The platform will offer a unique list of AI-driven tools and solutions to optimize the marketplace for applications and the performance of different providers.
* **Tiered-based plans**: Consumers can select different tiered plans with different options and advantages. The initial plan will offer limited access to the platform, such as a lower priority to commit to SLAs. At the same time, greater tiers will give more flexibility and possibilities with the platform, such as high-priority commitment SLAs and AI-driven tools for pricing and provider selections.&#x20;
