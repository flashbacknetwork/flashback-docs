# Unit Providers

The Flashback DePin platform aims to revolutionize the decentralized cloud ecosystem by proposing a network of providers incentivized by the quality-of-services and the results performed in the platform.

Individuals and companies with hardware resources can contribute directly to the Flashback platform by offering storage (compute in the future) services. They can choose to subscribe to different service tiers, allowing them to scale their participation based on their capacity and technical requirements. This approach opens opportunities for small-scale providers, such as individuals or small businesses, to join the ecosystem and monetize their hardware efficiently.

Alternatively, providers can participate by staking FLASH tokens, which acts as both a commitment to the platform and a mechanism to earn rewards. Staking ensures that only providers dedicated to maintaining high-quality standards can offer their services, fostering trust and reliability within the ecosystem. This dual model of subscription tiers and staking creates a flexible and accessible framework for hardware owners to join the decentralized storage revolution.

Here are the different fees and payments (in fiat or cryptocurrency) from the Hardware/Cloud Server layer:

* **SLA Payments of Providers**: Storage providers will receive payments from consumers for reserving and utilizing storage services under Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The payment terms will vary based on factors such as storage capacity, contract duration, redundancy, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameters. This ensures that providers are compensated fairly for their services while incentivizing high-quality performance in the marketplace.
* **Platform Marketplace Fees**:  The Flashback platform will charge a marketplace fee to facilitate seamless interactions between consumers and storage providers. These fees cover operational costs such as maintaining the decentralized infrastructure, enhancing the marketplace, and ensuring compliance.
* **Platform Options**: Storage providers can access a suite of advanced tools and features offered by the Flashback platform. These include AI-driven solutions for optimizing pricing strategies, improving QoS, supporting for compliance, and enhancing visibility in the marketplace.
* **Tiered-based plans**: Providers can subscribe to different tiered plans that grant them varying levels of access and advantages within the platform. Lower tiers provide basic access to marketplace listings and SLA commitments, while higher tiers unlock premium features such as priority marketplace positioning, advanced analytics, and AI-driven recommendations for maximizing storage utilization and profitability.
