# üè¶ Economy Model

The Flashback platform introduces a decentralized economic model that seamlessly connects consumers with sotrage and/or compute providers.&#x20;

Providers are incentivized to maintain high-quality services through performance rewards and penalties for SLA non-compliance.  Consumers will play a key role in the reputation system and Providers in the trust of offering resources.
