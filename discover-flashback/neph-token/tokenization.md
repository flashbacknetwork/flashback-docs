# Tokenization

Tokenization involves the creation and use of a digital asset, a native token, that serves as the primary medium for transactions, governance, and incentives within the platform. By leveraging tokenization, Flashback will:

* Simplify interactions between consumers and providers.
* Enable seamless payments across fiat and cryptocurrency ecosystems.
* Incentivize stakeholders through transparent and efficient mechanisms.
* Harmonize the operational and financial flows between centralized and decentralized providers.

The Flashback token, "FLASH," will be central to this tokenized ecosystem, bridging the gap between traditional fiat-based systems, the crypto-native economies of DePin providers, and the Flashback's storage providers.

## **Benefits of Tokenization**

Tokenizing the interactions between centralized and decentralized providers offers several advantages:

1. **Enhanced User Experience:** Consumers can interact with multiple providers using a single token and interface, simplifying the complexity of managing payments and resources.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** Discounts and rewards incentivize token usage, reducing costs for consumers while enhancing provider competition.
3. **Transparency and Trust:** Blockchain-based smart contracts ensure that SLAs and payments are executed transparently, minimizing disputes and fostering trust.
4. **Scalability:** The tokenized model supports the seamless addition of new providers, enabling the platform to scale with user demand.
5. **Community-Driven Development:** The FLASH token empowers the community to participate in governance, ensuring that the platform evolves in alignment with user needs.

## **Token Utility**

### **Consumers (Apps and Services)**

  * **Token Incentives:** Active users receive benefits and rewards.
  * **Achievement Rewards:** Consumers are rewarded for hitting milestones and improving service quality (e.g. contributing to scoring).

### **Hardware Storage Providers**

* **SLA Fee Benefits:** Storage providers who stake FLASH receive significant discounts on fees. Additionally, if consumers pay in FLASH, payments can be streamed directly to storage providers, bypassing the platform.

  * **Risk Offset:** Providers without penalties receive extra compensation to help cover hardware maintenance costs during an initial onboarding period.
  * **Token Incentives:** Providers who meet the marketplaceâ€™s quality of service (QoS) standards may earn bonus tokens as a percentage of SLA payments.
  * **Achievement Rewards:** Providers receive rewards for submitting legal registration details or reaching performance milestones.
* **Penalties:** If a provider fails to submit required reports in the smart contract or does not meet QoS terms in the SLA, their stake will be slashed, fees may increase, or payments may be locked as penalties.
