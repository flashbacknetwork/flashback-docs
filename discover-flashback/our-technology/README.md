This section explains how storage providers and consumers connect seamlessly through blockchain-based orchestrators. By leveraging decentralized smart contracts, Flashback ensures transparency, trust, and efficiency in all transactions.

Storage providers offer their capacity, registered and certified on the Flashback platform, to meet predefined quality standards. Consumers, including businesses and individuals, interact with these providers through orchestrators that manage storage allocation, service-level agreements (SLAs), and payments. This decentralized approach enhances discoverability, trust, and accountability, creating a reliable and efficient storage ecosystem.

At the network's core lies the **Orchestrator Smart Contract**, which acts as the trustless coordinator for the ecosystem. It ensures SLA compliance, tracks quality-of-service (QoS) metrics, manages payments, and enforces penalties for non-compliance. The platform also integrates advanced tokenomics through its native token, FLASH, facilitating payments, staking, and governance. Supported by oracles, the network bridges on-chain and off-chain data for real-time insights, while the OpenAPI module connects consumers and providers, enabling seamless interactions. Together, these components create a scalable and transparent storage infrastructure optimized for modern decentralized needs.
