The rise of Web3 technologies has led to the emergence of innovative concepts that challenge traditional models. Decentralized networks have paved the way for new solutions, offering greater transparency, security, and efficiency.

**Flashback DePin** is designed as a decentralized, trust-enforced system that connects consumers and providers while maintaining transparency through smart contracts. **Providers** and **Consumers** interact with our decentralized platform and **Smart Contract.** The smart contract ensures compliance, streamlines data and payment flows, while Flashback DePin enhances discoverability, trust, and accountability, supporting a reliable decentralized storage ecosystem.

## **Flashback DePin: A decentralized platform**

The Flashback DePin manages key operations, including service-level agreement (SLA) submissions, arbitration, and other advanced tools like a recommendation system and resource allocation optimizer.

To ensure flexibility, the solution supports both fiat and cryptocurrency payments (BTC, XLM, STRK, ALGO, and others) for services. The solution also offers consumers the freedom to choose from multiple blockchain networks that will support our smart contract. For instance, if the user is part of an ecosystem, they will be able to connect their ecosystem wallet and pay in tokens from this ecosystem. Meanwhile, the platform will handle payments and currency conversion until decentralized swap functions are integrated.

The solution atuhroizes any kind of providers from centralized Cloud like AWS or GCP as well as DePin solutions like Filecoin or AIOZ allowing diversification across different cloud solutions. The platform offers a range of tools and services to help consumers optimize and enhance their storage experience with the solution.

**Smart Contract Orchestrators**

Orchestrators communicate through **Flashback DePin**, ensuring that SLAs, payments, and quality metrics are synchronized and enforced.

* **Orchestrator for Providers**: Manages agreements, service-level parameters, and quality monitoring for providers. Provide the initial parameters to allow **P2P streams** while enforcing transparency and compliance in transactions.
* **Orchestrator for Consumers**: Handles payments, data access permissions, and SLA terms to ensure fair usage. Provides a decentralized mechanism for consumers to interact seamlessly with providers.

**Flashback DePin's Core Functions**

The core of the platform is where Flashback Inc. will run its main operations. It will integrate different layers of stacks and tools to guarantee a seamless and user-friendly integration into the applications and services of the consumers.

* **Register of Certified Providers:** A database within the Flashback platform that lists providers meeting certification requirements. Certification ensures providers meet quality-of-service (QoS) standards and can be trusted for SLAs.
* **Register of Certified Consumers**: Like the provider register, this registry certifies consumers offering auxiliary services (e.g., data migration, analytics, or compliance tools). Supports a robust ecosystem by vetting reliable providers.
* **Listing**: Acts as a public interface where providers are listed for consumers to browse and choose from. Facilitates discovery and selection while maintaining transparency about certifications and performance ratings.
* **Access to tools, SDKs, and APIs**: Provide the user interface with a complete API and support a software development kit (SDK) for customizing and improving P2P streams.  AI-driven tools and features to improve the consumers' experience with Flashback related to pricing management, quality-of-service designs, compliance, and more.

## **Consumers (or Unit Consumers)**

The Flashback DePin solution integrates a marketplace are the native medium of exchange for transactions in the ecosystem. Consumers subscribe to the platform or connect with their wallet, and pay providers to reserve and use services in an SLA. The Flashback network platform will provide a marketplace that lists the offers and manages payments.&#x20;

**Definition of a Consumer**

* Represent individuals, organizations, or applications requiring storage or compute solutions.&#x20;
* Interact with providers via the Flashback DePin solution and smart contract orchestrators to store, retrieve, or manage their data.

The SLA payments depend on the requested storage and/or compute, the contract duration, the providers, the redundancy, the QoS level, and other parameters that will be integrated into the SLA. Payment can be made in fiat currency or cryptocurrency.&#x20;

**Billing and Resource Allocation**

The platform will use billing processes by creating smart contracts for automated resource allocation and payments. For example:

* Consumers specify their storage and/or compute requirements (e.g., data volume, duration).
* Smart contracts dynamically calculate costs based on the selected provider’s pricing and allocate the required payment.
* Upon service delivery confirmation, payments are released to the provider, ensuring trust and transparency.

Hence, Flashback enhances operational efficiency, reduces friction for consumers, and introduces the advantages of blockchain-based payment systems.

## **Providers (or Unit Providers)**

The providers with storage and/or compute infrastructure directly connected to the platform will benefit from its design. COncerning the payment, it can be streamed directly to the provider's wallet but the platform may play a key role as an oracle to measure the performances of the provider with the consumers. The provider can pay a subscription to be listed on the platform and to stake the native tokens to be authorized for operations.&#x20;

As consumers, providers pay the platform to access multiple AI-driven tools, allowing them to propose the best pricing according to their hardware and QoS and be competitive against other providers.

Finally, the storage providers will have access to specific tools, such as the compliance system, to refer to all the legal documents, geographical locations, general performances, etc.

**Definition of a Provider**

The definition of a provider is:

* Entities offering storage and/or compute infrastructure by submitting storage or compute units in the marketplace or to accept a storage or compute requests from consumers. The provider is responsible for the infrastructure, the data protocol (IPFS, HTTPS, etc.), and all the software needed to interact with its infrastructure.
* Responsible for offering storage capacity to consumers and must meet the platform’s quality standards or consumers' requirements.&#x20;
* Registered and certified within the platform for trust and compliance.
