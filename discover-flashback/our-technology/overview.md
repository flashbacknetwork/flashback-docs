Today, the development of web3 technologies has led to the emergence of new concepts that break with traditional technologies. Decentralized networks have made it possible to implement new technologies and concepts.

**Flashback** is designed as a decentralized, trust-enforced system that connects users and storage providers while maintaining transparency through smart contracts. **Storage Providers (Cloud and Infrastructure)** and **Users (Applications and Services)** interact with the **Flashback Platform** and the **Smart Contract.** The smart contract ensures compliance and streamlines data and payment flows. The **Flashback platform** registers and listings enhance discoverability, trust, and accountability, supporting a reliable decentralized storage ecosystem.

## **Flashback Platform**

This layer mainly manages the operations of service-level agreements (SLA) submissions, arbitrages, and other tools such as a recommendation system and resource allocation optimizer. The platform will initially fiat and cryptocurrency payments (BTC, XLM, STRK, and some others) to pay for the services running on the top. The platform offers the users the freedom of choice: Multiple chains will support our smart contract. For instance, if the user is part of the Stellar ecosystem, he will be able to connect his Stellar wallet and pay in Stellar tokens. Otherwise, the platform will manage the payment and the currency conversion until the integration of decentralized swap functions.\
Flashback uses centralized Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud and allows to diversify on different centralized Cloud providers. The platform will propose a large panel of tools and services to the users for optimizing and experiencing the best storage with Flashback.

**Smart Contract Orchestrators**

Both orchestrators communicate through the **Flashback platform**, ensuring that SLAs, payments, and quality metrics are synchronized and enforced.

* **Orchestrator for Storage Providers**: Manages agreements, service-level parameters, and quality monitoring for storage providers. Orchestrate the **P2P streams** by enforcing transparency and compliance in transactions.
* **Orchestrator for Users**: Handles payments, data access permissions, and SLA terms to ensure fair usage. Provides a decentralized mechanism for users to interact seamlessly with storage providers.

**Flashback Platform Core**

The core of the platform is where Flashback Inc. will run its main operations. It will integrate different layers of stacks and tools to guarantee a seamless and user-friendly integration into the applications and services of the users.

* **Register of Certified Storage Providers:** A database within the Flashback platform that lists storage providers meeting certification requirements. Certification ensures providers meet quality-of-service (QoS) standards and can be trusted for SLAs.
* **Register of Certified Service Providers**: Like the storage provider register, this registry certifies users offering auxiliary services (e.g., data migration, analytics, or compliance tools). Supports a robust ecosystem by vetting reliable providers.
* **Listing**: Acts as a public interface where storage and service providers are listed for users to browse and choose from. Facilitates discovery and selection while maintaining transparency about certifications and performance ratings.
* **Access to tools, SDKs, and APIs**: Provide the user interface with a complete API and support a software development kit (SDK) for customizing and improving P2P streams.  AI-driven tools and features to improve the users' experience with Flashback related to pricing management, quality-of-service designs, compliance, and more.

## **Users (Applications and Services)**

The Flashback platform integrates a marketplace are the native medium of exchange for transactions in the ecosystem. Users subscribe to the platform or connect with their wallet, and pay storage providers to reserve and use storage services in an SLA. The Flashback network platform will provide a marketplace that lists the offers and manages payments.&#x20;

**Definition of a user**

* Represent individuals, organizations, or applications requiring storage solutions.&#x20;
* Interact with storage providers via the Flashback platform and smart contract orchestrators to store, retrieve, or manage their data.

The SLA payments depend on the requested storage, the contract duration, the cloud providers, the redundancy, the QoS level, and other parameters that will be integrated into the SLA. Payment can be made in fiat currency or cryptocurrency.&#x20;

**Billing and Resource Allocation**

The platform will use billing processes by creating smart contracts for automated resource allocation and payments. For example:

* Users specify their storage requirements (e.g., data volume, duration).
* Smart contracts dynamically calculate costs based on the selected provider’s pricing and allocate the required payment.
* Upon service delivery confirmation, payments are released to the provider, ensuring trust and transparency.

Hence, Flashback enhances operational efficiency, reduces friction for users, and introduces the advantages of blockchain-based payment systems.

## **Storage Providers (Cloud or Infrastructure)**

The providers with storage infrastructure directly connected to the Flashback platform will benefit from its design. According to the currency in the SLA, the platform may participate as an intermediary of payment. Nonetheless, with the proper configuration, the payment in the SLA can be streamed directly to the infrastructure storage provider's wallet. The infrastructure storage provider can pay a subscription to be listed on the platform or stake the platform's native tokens to be authorized for operations.&#x20;

As users, storage providers pay the platform to access multiple AI-driven tools, allowing them to propose the best pricing according to their hardware and QoS and be competitive against other providers.

Finally, the storage providers will have access to specific tools, such as the compliance system, to refer to all the legal documents, geographical locations, general performances, etc.

The definition of an infrastructure storage provider is:

* Entities offering storage spaces, such as decentralized or traditional storage systems.&#x20;
* Responsible for offering storage capacity to users and must meet the platform’s quality standards or users' requirements.&#x20;
* Registered and certified within the Flashback platform for trust and compliance.

The Flashback platform allows the users to have access to their favorite Cloud providers. A user will connect and grant the credentials to the Flashback platform to use their AWS or GCP accounts. The perfect match for people who want to consume their free credits from different providers.
