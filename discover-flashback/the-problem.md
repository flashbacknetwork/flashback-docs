# The Problem

Due to a lack of trust in centralized cloud providers, **93% of organizations use a multi-cloud strategy**, and **87% combine public and private clouds in hybrid environments**. Unfortunately,[the-situation.md](../learn/depin-and-cloud-storage-1/the-situation.md "mention") shows a weak adoption where the network can't support the mass adoption. However, these approaches still fail to address critical issues. Here is the problem that Flashback will tend to solve:

1. **Security and Governance in File Transfers**:\
   Multi-cloud solutions often rely on centralized coordination, leaving organizations vulnerable to downtime and breaches. According to Deloitte Insights, companies allocate **10.9% of their IT budgets to cybersecurity**, yet vulnerabilities persist. These centralized processes make it challenging for companies to estimate the risk and weaken their governance.&#x20;
2. **High Costs of Cloud Management**:\
   While **companies employ a hybrid and multi-cloud strategy** (Flexera), **30% of cloud spending is wasted** due to inefficiencies, mismanagement, and lack of optimization. The system is known as **Pay-As-You-Go,** and while it provides flexibility in the early stage, it leads to ignoring the expenses related to cloud storage and unexpected bills at the end of the month.
3. **Barriers to DePin Adoption**:\
   Decentralized storage (DePin) is a viable alternative, with **62% of IT decision-makers** finding it reliable or more reliable than traditional cloud solutions (The State of DeStor 2024). Yet, **72% are not using DePin solutions**, citing complexity, poor quality of service (QoS), compliance concerns, and slow retrieval speeds, making it suitable only for cold storage.
