# Prove Replica Update 2

**Prove Replica Update 2** is a critical phase within the Filecoin SnapDeal sealing process. This phase involves compressing the proof generated in Prove Replica Update 1 into a smaller, zk-SNARK-based proof that is suitable for submission to the blockchain. This step ensures that the new data has been correctly and securely integrated into an existing sealed sector.

## **Overview**

* **Objective**: The primary goal of Prove Replica Update 2 is to generate a zk-SNARK (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) proof. This proof validates that the new data has been correctly encoded within the sector while maintaining the security and integrity of the original data. The zk-SNARK proof is small enough to be efficiently stored on the blockchain.
* **Context**: This phase follows the Prove Replica Update 1 phase, where an initial cryptographic proof was created. In Prove Replica Update 2, this proof is further processed and compressed, making it suitable for on-chain storage.

## **Parameters and Environment Setup**

* **Cryptographic Proof Compression**: During Prove Replica Update 2, the initial proof generated in the previous phase is compressed into a zk-SNARK proof. This process is computationally intensive, requiring significant processing power.
* **CPU Requirements**: Although a powerful CPU can perform this task, it is the GPU that plays a crucial role in this phase. The GPU accelerates the process of generating zk-SNARK proofs, significantly reducing the time required.
* **GPU Requirements**: A high-performance GPU with at least 10 GB of VRAM (such as an NVIDIA RTX 2080 or better) is recommended to efficiently handle the zk-SNARK proof generation. GPUs with more CUDA cores and higher VRAM will further enhance the performance and reduce processing time.
* **Memory and Storage Utilization**: The memory and storage demands for Prove Replica Update 2 are moderate, as the focus is on processing the existing proof rather than handling large amounts of raw data.

## **Process Execution**

* **Proof Compression**: The initial proof from Prove Replica Update 1 is processed and compressed into a zk-SNARK proof. This proof is designed to be succinct, ensuring that it occupies minimal space on the blockchain while still providing strong cryptographic guarantees.
* **GPU Utilization**: The GPU is heavily utilized in this phase, accelerating the complex mathematical computations involved in zk-SNARK proof generation. This ensures that the proof can be generated within a reasonable timeframe, even for large datasets.
* **Security Considerations**: The zk-SNARK proof generated in Prove Replica Update 2 is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Filecoin network. It ensures that the new data has been securely integrated into the sector without compromising the security of the original data.

## **Final Steps and Time Considerations**

* **Time Efficiency**: The duration of Prove Replica Update 2 depends on the GPU's performance and the complexity of the proof. However, with a powerful GPU, this phase can be completed relatively quickly, typically within minutes.
* **Proof Submission**: Once the zk-SNARK proof is generated, it is ready for submission to the blockchain. This proof serves as a permanent, verifiable record that the storage provider has correctly integrated the new data into the existing sector.

By thoroughly understanding the Prove Replica Update 2 phase, storage providers can optimize their hardware configurations to ensure efficient and secure proof generation. Proper execution of this phase is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the Filecoin network, particularly when dealing with complex data integrations through the SnapDeal process.
