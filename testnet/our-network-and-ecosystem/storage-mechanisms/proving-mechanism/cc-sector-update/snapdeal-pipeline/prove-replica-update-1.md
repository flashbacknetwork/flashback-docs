# Prove Replica Update 1

**Prove Replica Update 1** is an essential step within the SnapDeal process of the Filecoin network. This phase focuses on proving that the data has been correctly and securely integrated into an already existing sealed sector. It ensures that the update to the sector, which involves adding new deal data, maintains the cryptographic integrity of the original data.

## **Overview**

* **Objective**: The primary purpose of Prove Replica Update 1 is to generate an initial proof that the newly encoded data (deal data) has been correctly integrated into the pre-existing sealed sector. This proof demonstrates that the storage provider has securely updated the sector without violating the integrity of the original sealed data.
* **Context**: This phase follows the Replica Update phase, where new data was encoded into the existing sector. In Prove Replica Update 1, the integrity of this updated sector is verified through cryptographic proofs, which serve as the foundation for the subsequent Prove Replica Update 2 phase.

## **Parameters and Environment Setup**

* **Proof Generation**: During Prove Replica Update 1, the system generates a cryptographic proof to verify that the new data has been correctly encoded. This process involves mathematical computations that ensure the validity and integrity of the sectorâ€™s updated state.
* **CPU Requirements**: This phase primarily relies on CPU resources to handle the cryptographic operations required for proof generation. While it is less intensive than tasks requiring SHA256 or GPU acceleration, it still benefits from a powerful, multi-core CPU.
* **Memory and Storage Utilization**: The memory and storage requirements for Prove Replica Update 1 are moderate, as the phase involves processing and verifying the encoded data rather than manipulating large amounts of raw data.

## **Process Execution**

* **Initial Proof Generation**: The core activity in Prove Replica Update 1 is generating the initial proof that the new data has been correctly encoded into the sector. This proof is lighter compared to the final proof generated in Prove Replica Update 2, as it only needs to verify the correctness of the data encoding.
* **Data Integrity Verification**: The phase ensures that the update has not altered the original data's integrity. This involves a series of cryptographic checks to confirm that the new data has been seamlessly integrated into the existing sealed sector.
* **Security Considerations**: The proofs generated in this phase are essential for maintaining the overall security and reliability of the Filecoin network. By ensuring that all data updates are cryptographically sound, the network can prevent tampering and maintain trust in the storage system.

## **Final Steps and Time Considerations**

* **Proof Generation Time**: The time required to complete Prove Replica Update 1 depends on the complexity of the data update and the computational power of the CPU. However, this phase is generally faster than the subsequent Prove Replica Update 2 phase, as it involves generating an initial, less-complex proof.
* **Transition to Prove Replica Update 2**: Once the initial proof is generated, the process transitions to Prove Replica Update 2, where the proof is compressed into a zk-SNARK proof for blockchain submission.
