# What is a Storage Deal?

A **storage deal** in Filecoin is an agreement between a **client** (the entity that wants to store data) and a **storage provider** to store a specific piece of data on the Filecoin network for a specified duration and price. The storage deal is a fundamental mechanism that allows users to utilize the decentralized storage capabilities of the Filecoin network while ensuring that storage providers are compensated for their services.

## **Key Components of a Storage Deal in Filecoin**

### **Data Storage Agreement**

A storage deal is a contract specifying the terms under which the storage provider agrees to store a client's data. These terms include **data size**, **storage duration**, **price**, **collateral**, and **replication requirements**.

Clients can **manually negotiate** deals with specific storage providers or use **deal-making tools** and **automated matching services** to find the best provider based on criteria like price, reputation, and geographic location.

### **On-Chain and Off-Chain Components**

&#x20;The storage deal terms, commitments, and payments are recorded on the Filecoin blockchain. This ensures transparency and immutability, providing a verifiable record of the agreement and its compliance.

The actual data storage and management occur off-chain on the storage provider's infrastructure. The provider is responsible for maintaining the data and generating cryptographic proofs to prove the data's continued storage.

### **Pricing and Payment Terms**

The client and the storage provider negotiate the **price** for storing the data in FIL. This price can be influenced by factors such as the data's size, the storage duration, the storage provider's reputation, and current market conditions.

### **Collateral and Incentives**

Storage providers must lock up **collateral** in FIL when making storage deals. This collateral guarantees that the provider will honor the terms of the deal. If the provider fails to maintain the data or provide the necessary proof, it may lose its collateral as a penalty. Collateral and deal payments incentivize storage providers to be reliable and maintain high uptime and data integrity.
