# Create a Flashback Account

## Introduction

Creating a Flashback account is straightforward and free by installing a cryptocurrency wallet app. Wallets facilitate the management of your Flashback account. They enable you to send transactions, check your balances, and connect with applications developed on the Flashback network.

With a single wallet, you can instantly log into various platforms such as token exchanges, gaming platforms, and NFT marketplaces without needing separate registrations.

## Prerequisites

We recommend you to read the [Ethereum specifications with Flashback](../../learn/our-network-and-ecosystem/ethereum-stack-in-nephele/).

## Steps of the Guide

### **Step 1: Select a Wallet**

* **Choose Your Wallet**: A wallet is an application that assists you in managing your Flashback account. There are several types of wallets including mobile apps, desktop programs, and browser extensions. As Flashback is EVM-compatible, you a use [a wallet from the Ethereum environment](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet/).
* **For Beginners**: If you’re new to cryptocurrencies, look for wallets that are beginner-friendly, which can be identified using a “New to crypto” filter on the "find a wallet" page of many wallet directories.
* **Research**: It's crucial to do your own research before choosing a wallet, as it will handle important functions like transaction signing and account recovery.

### **Step 2: Download and Install Your Wallet**

* **Official Sources**: Always download wallet apps from their official website or a reputable app store to avoid counterfeit applications.

### **Step 3: Create Your Account**

* **Account Setup**: Upon opening your wallet for the first time, choose the option to create a new account. This will trigger the wallet to generate your new Flashback account.
* **Existing Accounts**: Alternatively, if you have an existing account, most wallets will give you the option to import it using your existing credentials.

### **Step 4: Secure Your Recovery Phrase**

* **Save Your Recovery Phrase**: During the setup process, you’ll likely be prompted to write down a recovery phrase, also known as a "seed phrase" or "mnemonic." This is crucial for account recovery and security.
* **Keep It Private**: This phrase, typically made up of 12 to 24 randomly generated words, must be kept secure and private. Anyone with access to this phrase can control your funds.

## Additional Information

* **Wallet vs. Account**: Your wallet manages your accounts; it’s not an account itself. One wallet can manage multiple accounts, and multiple wallets can access one account through the recovery phrase.
* **Cross-Network Transactions**: You cannot send $FLASH to a Bitcoin address or bitcoins to a Flashback address due to different network protocols and address formats.
* **Multi-Blockchain Use**: Your Flashback address may be used on other EVM-compatible blockchains. Check compatible networks here.
* **Self-Custody Safety**: Having your own wallet puts the responsibility of security in your hands. While it eliminates reliance on third parties like exchanges, it also requires you to be vigilant about security risks such as phishing or scams.
* **Device Loss Recovery**: If you lose your device, you can recover your funds using your recovery phrase on a different wallet app. Always ensure to do this offline to prevent potential leaks of your sensitive information.
