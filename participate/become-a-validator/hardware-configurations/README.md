# Hardware Configurations

Flashback proposes a genesis with the [Proof-of-Stake-Spacetime](../../../learn/consensus-proof-of-stake-spacetime.md) (PoS-ST) consensus mechanism. The staking role ensures that the minimal hardware requirements for running a validator node are significantly less demanding than those for mining in a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system. \
A validator can function as a pure staking validator, performing only the staking duty. However, if the validator chooses to enable the storage duties, the node will not only perform the staking duty but also receive revenues from the storage provision and the network's utility.\
Flashback will host a diverse range of validators, including PoS-only and PoS-ST validators. Over time, these validators will increasingly take on the staking and storage duties. This will not only reinforce the network's utility but also foster its growth in an organic, collaborative, and utility-driven approach, ensuring a robust and sustainable network.

Nonetheless, a validator can only be run while respecting the minimal requirements for staking and storage. The hardware science is complex, and this document indicates the hardware a validator can use for its duties. The validator owner must remain free of the hardware stacks to best support the network.
