# Examples of Self-Managed Setups

_<mark style="color:red;">No endorsement of any hardware provider is made here. The information provided is purely indicative. Please do your own research.</mark>_

A self-managed setup for running a PoS validator node can offer greater control and potentially lower long-term costs thana cloud service. I've included below a suggested hardware setup along with estimated costs for purchasing the hardware. Additionally, Iâ€™ll provide an estimate of operating costs such as electricity bills and maintenance, with a breakdown for 2 years and 5 years.
