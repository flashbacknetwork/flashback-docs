# Become a Validator

The proof-of-stake spacetime (PoS-ST) has different responsibilities as validators. The validators are primarily staking-based, equivalent to Ethereum's validators. A validator stores data processes transactions and adds new blocks to the blockchain. However, the storage duties are limited to on-chain data storage. &#x20;

The validators can decide to be storage providers by enabling the proof-of-spacetime (PoSt) commitments as validators. This way, you extend your duties with off-chain file storage, the cornerstone of our DePIN-based cloud storage.

## Why being a validator?

### Earn rewards

Rewards are given for activities that help keep the network secure and running smoothly. You'll earn staking rewards for running Nephele software that groups transactions into new blocks and verifies the work of others. This is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the chain.

A validator can decide to participate in the file storage duties by allowing the commitment of storage proofs. After setting your parameters and operating fees (what people must pay to store files in your validator), you'll earn rewards according to your performances assessed by the [quality-of-network (QoN) optimizer](../learn/our-network-and-ecosystem/storage-mechanisms/quality-of-network-qon-optimizer.md). You will participate in the diversity of storage offers and be a founder of the mass adoption of innovative use cases in the web3 ecosystem.

### Support the security and privacy of data

The network becomes more secure against attacks as more NEPH is staked. This is because controlling most of the network would require owning the most staked NEPH. Essentially, the more NEPH staked, the harder it is for anyone to gain enough control to pose a threat. You will be a cornerstone of the security and decentralization of the network.&#x20;

If you enable file storage, you can participate in the cloud storage layer and improve the network's security, privacy, and value. You will be the precursor of a fairer and competitive world where every individual and business can store their files according to their requirements.&#x20;

### Sustainable and Profitability&#x20;

Doing staking is the best way to consume limited resources, the opposite of the proof-of-work or proof-of-capacity-based systems. This is why Nephele used the staking model, which offers a simple incentive layer for the validators to manage their operating costs.&#x20;

With our novel [proof](../learn/our-network-and-ecosystem/blockchain-network/consensus-proof-of-stake-spacetime.md), you can also parametrize as you want the storage duties and how you want to commit them to the network. This unique flexibility will allow you to develop a business model with your storage and be competitive.&#x20;
