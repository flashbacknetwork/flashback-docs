# ðŸ™Œ Contribute to the Documentation

## Introduction

Flashback technology is rapidly evolving, and comprehensive documentation is crucial for its adoption and development. Whether you're an experienced developer or a newcomer, your contributions to blockchain documentation, tutorials, and how-to guides can significantly impact you and are rewarded. This guide will walk you through effectively contributing to blockchain knowledge resources.

## Why Contribute?

1. **Enhance Understanding**: Contributing to documentation helps solidify understanding of blockchain concepts. Become an expert in Flashback, and you can become an ambassador or ecosystem mentor to newcomers.
2. **Community Growth**: High-quality resources attract more developers and users, fostering a robust blockchain community. You, as a community member, are the foundation of Flashback and its emergence as a referral cloud solution.
3. **Professional Development**: Contributing showcases your expertise and can be valuable to your portfolio as well as to a recognized ecosystem in the blockchain industry.

## Types of Contributions

1. **Documentation**: Improve existing documentation or create new content for blockchain projects. This can be a tutorial, an introductive video about a feature, or an overview of the technology.
2. **Tutorials**: Write step-by-step guides to help others learn how to use blockchain tools and technologies. It is how we will have more users and builders in Flashback.
3. **How-to Guides**: Develop detailed instructions for tasks such as setting up a blockchain node or creating a smart contract.

## Getting Started

### 1. Understand the Contribution Guidelines

Read contribution guidelines. Look for a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the repository. This document will provide information on:

* Software and Cloud tools: Flashback is doing storage (and computing in the future). We appreciate your participation to our open-source codes related to data storage.

### 3. Identify Areas for Improvement

Start by reviewing our existing documentation to identify gaps or areas for improvement. Look for:

* Outdated information (Blockchain is a fast-evolving ecosystem ... Help us to be always at the edge of new technologies)
* Missing tutorials (Possibilities with Flashback is infinite; you will be the contributor of our amazing journey)
* Ambiguous instructions (Explaining is everything and the foundation of education which requires iterative implementation)
