Cloud storage is an exponentially growing ecosystem, with companies proposing increasingly efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions. While centralized infrastructure remains undoubtedly the most prominent solution, the companies behind these infrastructures suffer from many challenges related to hacking, user privacy, and company sovereignty. Although several governments have established general data protection regulations (GDPR) to protect cloud users, enforcing these laws has proved challenging due to variations in enforcement across borders. To address these challenges and data protection, leveraging decentralization through blockchain technology emerges as an affordable and reliable solution.&#x20;

This section introduces the whitepaper of Nephele, a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN)-based cloud storage to enhance existing blockchain technologies. Nephele proposes a decentralizing storage infrastructure where nodes assume a hybrid role alongside the decentralized ledger. This decentralized infrastructure requires additional security and novel concepts.&#x20;

Let's introduce more of the problems that Nephele is solving and explore the different principles and features behind the hood.
