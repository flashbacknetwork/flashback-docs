# Power Actor

The **Power Actor** in Filecoin is a core component that manages the **storage power** of each **storage provider (miner)** in the network. Storage power measures the amount of verifiable storage a miner contributes to the Filecoin network. The Power Actor is responsible for keeping track of each miner's storage power, directly affecting their probability of winning block rewards and their overall influence in the network's consensus mechanism.

## **Technical Overview**

* **Built-in Actor:**\
  The Power Actor is a built-in actor in the Filecoin protocol, implemented in **Lotus** and other Filecoin clients. It is an essential component that ensures the proper functioning of the network's storage-based consensus mechanism.
* **Smart Contract-Like Functionality:**\
  Like other actors, the Power Actor functions like a smart contract that manages the state, enforces rules, and coordinates with other actors to maintain network integrity.

The Filecoin Power Actor manages miners' storage power, critical for network consensus, block reward distribution, and overall network security. It tracks each miner's storage power, calculates the total network power, handles penalties and faults, and ensures that only compliant miners participate in the Filecoin network.
