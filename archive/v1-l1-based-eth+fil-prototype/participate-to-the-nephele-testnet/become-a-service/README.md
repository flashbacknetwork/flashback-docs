# Become a Service Gateway

The Flashback network is a unique and specialized system designed exclusively to support the data storage of web applications and services. It is not a content-delivery network, as its validators do not manage file-sharing operations, further highlighting its distinct role.

The service gateways will be able to use the network by following simple steps:

* **Define the File Transfer Protocol**: Flashback is FTP agnostic, which means the business or individual will define its transfer protocol according to its needs and clients' specifications. This is an off-chain procedure and independent of the Flashback protocol. A business can then develop any kind of service at the edge of the local laws.
* **Deal with the storage marketplace**: Flashback invites the service gateways to interact directly with the storage providers to determine an agreement before committing it to the QoN optimizer.

Hence, Flashback must be connected with content-delivery networks (CDN) that are the service gateways communicating with the protocol. These operations are off-chain and controlled by the operators, which means they are responsible for respecting the laws and their quality of services.
