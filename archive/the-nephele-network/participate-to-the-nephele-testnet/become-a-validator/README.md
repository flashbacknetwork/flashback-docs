# Become a Validator

The validator in the Flashback network has two roles:

* A full node or archive node: The validator will validate the transactions in the blockchain using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) derived from Ethereum,
* A storage provider: The validator can run an additional daemon (software) to propose the additional data storage in its servers, which demands executing the Proof-of-Spacetime (PoSt) derived from Filecoin.  &#x20;

Hence, using Flashback as a storage medium, a validator can perform the PoS as a pure blockchain operator or as an additional storage provision to increase users' incomes.
