# Staking Validators

The cornerstone of the Ethereum ecosystem is the consensus supported by a widespread, global, and decentralized peer-to-peer network. Every node in this node that validates the blocks and other operations is called the validator. The validators are simply the [full nodes](../basics/nodes-and-clients-1.md) running the proof-of-stake consensus, guaranteeing that an external party can't alter an operation.

The validators represent an elementary component of Ethereum and are crucial for its global operation. You can read everything you need in this section.
