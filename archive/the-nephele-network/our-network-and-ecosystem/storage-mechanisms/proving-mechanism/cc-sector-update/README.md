# CC Sector Update

In Filecoin, **SnapDeals** is specifically designed to add deals to **Committed Capacity (CC) sectors**. A CC sector is an empty sector that a storage provider has sealed and committed to the network. It doesn't contain any user data yetâ€”effectively, it's a placeholder sector.

Since CC sectors do not initially contain real data, they are flexible and can later be filled with client data (deals). This flexibility is crucial for SnapDeals because the process involves adding new deal data into an already sealed sector without resealing the entire sector from scratch.

On the other hand, once a sector contains deal data (making it a "deal sector"), it is sealed in a specific cryptographic state that includes commitments to the data it holds. Any change to the data would require resealing the sector to produce a new Proof-of-Replication (PoRep). <mark style="color:red;">**This is why deal sectors are unsuitable for SnapDeals**</mark>; they already have their data commitments finalized, and altering this state would break the proofs.
