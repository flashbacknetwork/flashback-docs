# Actors: The Software Components

Key actors such as the **Storage Miner Actor**, **Market Actor**, **Power Actor**, and **Reward Actor** coordinate the network's economic, operational, and consensus mechanisms. the **Power Actor** tracks storage power contributions of miners, affecting their eligibility for mining rewards and consensus participation; and the **Reward Actor** distributes block rewards based on storage power and consensus rules. Together, these actors, supported by **Account Actors** that represent user accounts and manage FIL balances, form a robust ecosystem that ensures data integrity, incentivizes decentralized storage, and maintains network security and growth.
