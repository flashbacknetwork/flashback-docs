# Evolution of Cloud Storage

The world is becoming increasingly numeric, where data is its fuel.  As fuel, it must be stored and distributed. The emergence of the internet and subsequent services have enabled people to effortlessly communicate, share, and store their information and data with their families, friends, governments, and other entities.&#x20;

This massive data storage makes up the foundation of Big Dataâ€”a phenomenon aimed at enhancing the quality of services and user experience through analyzing large-scale datasets or training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These new technologies brought the emergence of new applications in the supply chain, healthcare, and language inference. The data storage market made over $180 billion in revenues in 2023, and the simulation evaluates this market to be over $700 billion in 2032. (see [here](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-storage-market-102991)) Today, everyone has a mobile phone with diverse applications, which densifies the stratum of interaction in the numeric world.&#x20;

Managing and storing such large amounts of data requires an enormous infrastructure in computer science. Cloud data storage has quickly become the go-to solution companies use because of the increasing number of data breaches associated with traditional and local storage solutions, their lack of accessibility worldwide, the interoperability issues, and the deployment costs of establishing new infrastructure.

## The dawn of cloud storage with centralized operators

Whereas personal computers were the best data storage medium in the 80s, the need for faster data transfer rates and more efficient storage solutions propelled the adoption of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) via the Internet as time progressed. At the end of the '90s, large IT firms imagined creating a distributed network globally to provide total accessibility to its data. This gives the foundation for integrating streaming platforms and social media into our daily lives.&#x20;

This new generation of data storage is dominating the data storage market segment, with a total revenue of $99.2 billion in 2023. The cloud data storage market emerged, featuring companies such as Google, Amazon Web Services, Baidu, and Microsoft, now leaders in the industry.

Centralizing and consolidating power among these major companies has led to many concerns regarding data privacy, legal compliance, and data governance, particularly in Europe. Furthermore, the escalating number of data breaches each year demonstrates the growing vulnerability in centralized solutions, reflecting increasing interest among hackers. Moreover, centralized solutions can potentially subject data to foreign censorship, compromise privacy by sharing foreign customers' data, or increase storage fees, which doubled from 2018 to 2023.

## A new hope with decentralized physical infrastructure networks

These security and data privacy concerns have resulted in various projects developing decentralized networks, often known as Decentralized Cloud, Web3 Cloud, Web3 Storage, or decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN)-based Cloud Storage. Notable projects in this domain include Filecoin and Arweave.&#x20;

The concept of these solutions is based on a blockchain in a peer-to-peer network, which drives a decentralized economy model supported by consensus and an ensemble of rules. This philosophy comes from Satoshi with Bitcoin, but these DePIN solutions focus on cloud storage problems. It brings multiple advantages compared to centralized solutions:

* **Lower cybersecurity costs**: The existing blockchain brings more security by having a public, transparent, and freely auditable code and infrastructure, reducing the cybersecurity costs implied today in centralized solutions.&#x20;
* **Permissionless and privacy:**  The decentralization guarantees that an organization can't censor the data storage itself. An individual or a company can interact with the network protocols without requiring the authorization of a central entity or a service provider. Anyone can decide to become a storage provider by offering its storage hardware to the network.
* **Pricing competitiveness:** Individuals or service providers using the network can decide to manage their storage by selecting the protocols and nodes they want to interact with. It minimizes the risk of data losses, and users can play with the network node pricing to optimize their profitability. This stimulates the competitiveness between storage providers always to find the best hardware setup and installation.

Nowadays, the leaders of the DePIN-based cloud storage are focusing on the archive segment because of technical limitations, but, as you will learn on the next page, it has severe consequences.
