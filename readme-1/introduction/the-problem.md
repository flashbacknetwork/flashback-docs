# The Problem

Despite their extraordinary impact on cloud storage, the Web3 ecosystem has yet to embrace them fully, with even the most extensive network, Filecoin, being utilized at only 1% of its capacity by the end of 2022 (see [here](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/the-state-of-decentralized-storage)). This is mainly because of the technical limitations of the existing solutions focusing on archives.

Despite the significant potential of DePIN solutions, they remain relatively scarce, and where they do exist, thereâ€™s much room for improvement in quality and user experience. Most data stored in centralized solutions are often non-permanent data or data for intensively demanding applications like Artificial Intelligence (AI), data-driven market analysis, or video games.

Hence, many Web3 companies (90% of them representing a loss of $1b in 2023 for the web3 ecosystem) still rely on centralized providers like Google or Amazon, primarily due to the inefficiency and high costs associated with decentralized options. This reliance presents substantial trust and security concerns, but the most significant part is the lack of competitiveness of web3 service providers against the web2 solutions in their market segment.

## The unsolved key challenges of DePIN-based Cloud Storage

### Profitability and file download speed

The existing solutions do not offer a suitable economy model to support diverse infrastructure providers while ensuring the services have the best quality hardware provided to the network.&#x20;

_Filecoin, Arweave, and Crust_ use the storage power principle, respectively. They encourage the storage providers to offer the network the most significant data storage capacity and large amounts of data to win block rewards. This leads to the impoverishment of network quality and decentralization of low-quality equipment that is massively connected in a few nodes. It decreases the file download speed. The protocols intend this because they focus on archives, but as we exposed earlier, they do not meet the world's needs.&#x20;

_Flux, AIOZ, or Storj (and_ deploying centralized systems (limited number of validators or permission-based storage providing system), guaranteeing a good file download speed. The profitability of the storage providers (and the right to participate) depends on an entity that is against the permissionless principle of web3.

Siacoin has storage fees explicitly set up by storage providers in an on-chain marketplace. This feature is the best scenario for diverse hardware quality in the network, as it ensures no unfair competition by design. Siacoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm for the block validation consensus. This means a storage provider must spend considerable money to benefit directly from the network valuation. Additionally, there is no incentive mechanism to support faster file download speed by the storage providers.

### Data compliance and sovereignty







* **Compliance (sovereignty) and Integration**: Decentralized storage solutions struggle with meeting compliance standards for interoperability, traceability, security, and data confidentiality. Additionally, developers face steep learning curves, and businesses struggle to integrate these solutions into existing processes.
* **Utilization and Adoption**: A 2022 Coingecko report highlighted that the most extensive Web3 data storage solution was operating at just 1% of its capacity, with revenues from all decentralized solutions combined representing only 0.1% of AWS's revenues. Moreover, a survey revealed that while 80% of Web3 companies need cloud data storage, only 6% use a Web3 cloud solution, citing complex networks, poor profitability, and inadequate user experience as primary barriers.
