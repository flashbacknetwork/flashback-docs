# Our Network and Ecosystem

The web is constantly evolving, and we're here to solve [the problem ](../introduction/the-problem.md)that will support a brighter future for individuals and companies. The new generation of technologies saw mass adoption when the services and applications using them significantly improved user experience (UX). In DePIN-based cloud storage, the UX is not just a feature; it's the backbone of our core technologies. \
\
How can we become the future backbone of cloud storage? This is Nephele's mission: to drive the innovations of tomorrow and its features to guarantee that:

* The storage providers must be profitable. Whatever the hardware quality provided to the network, this must be possible, but ultimately, if the hardware is the best quality you can find from hardware manufacturers.
* The service providers must be efficient. The network must support an economy that pushes the token's utility to reward the best quality of services, which means a fast file download speed and lets the service providers be responsible for the design of its system in the network.&#x20;
* The developers must be happy. The integration of the network must provide easy-to-use implementation frameworks. Deploying a dApp must use what they know the best, and integrating a network as a storage medium should not be time-consuming in learning.&#x20;

Let's discover the network and its ecosystem together. The following pages will give you all the understanding about our network.&#x20;
