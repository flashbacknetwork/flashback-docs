# Layer-1

Layer 1 refers to the base layer of a blockchain network architecture. It is the foundational layer that directly handles the main functions of a blockchain, such as transaction validation, consensus, and data storage.&#x20;

#### Key Characteristics of Layer-1:

1. **Decentralized Ledger**: They maintain a distributed ledger that records all transactions and state changes across the network.
2. **Consensus Mechanism**: Layer-1 blockchains implement consensus protocols (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof-of-Stake-Spacetime) that allow nodes to agree on the state of the blockchain and validate transactions.
3. **Security**: They provide the security foundation for the entire network, ensuring data integrity and resistance to attacks.
4. **Native Cryptocurrency**: Most Layer-1 blockchains have a native cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin for Bitcoin, Ether for Ethereum Neph for Nephele) used for transactions and incentivizing network participants.
5. **Smart Contract Functionality**: Some Layer-1 blockchains, like Ethereum and Nephele, support smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.

Layer-1 blockchains are critical as they form the foundation for other solutions and enhancements (like Layer-2 protocols). They provide the essential infrastructure for the operation and security of the entire blockchain ecosystem, enabling various applications from digital currencies to complex decentralized applications.
