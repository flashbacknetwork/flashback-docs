### What is a Blockchain?

## What is a Blockchain? <a href="#what-is-a-blockchain" id="what-is-a-blockchain"></a>

A blockchain is a decentralized public database continually updated and shared across multiple computers, known as nodes, within a network. The term "block" refers to individual data and state units stored in sequential groups, known as blocks. When you send network tokens to another user, the transaction data is added to one of these blocks for the transaction to be successful.

The term "chain" highlights that each block is cryptographically linked to its predecessor, forming a continuous, unalterable chain of blocks. This linkage ensures that altering the data in a single block would require changing all subsequent blocks, which demands the consensus of the entire network.

Nodes, the computers within the network, play a crucial role in maintaining the blockchain's integrity. They verify and agree upon each new block and the overall state of the chain, ensuring all participants have a consistent view of the data. To achieve this distributed agreement, blockchains employ a consensus mechanism, a set of protocols and rules that nodes follow to validate and synchronize the data across the network.

## What is a Layer-1? <a href="#what-is-a-blockchain" id="what-is-a-blockchain"></a>

Layer 1 refers to the base layer of a blockchain network architecture. It is the foundational layer that directly handles the main functions of a blockchain, such as transaction validation, consensus, and data storage.&#x20;

#### Key Characteristics of Layer-1:

1. **Decentralized Ledger**: They maintain a distributed ledger that records all transactions and state changes across the network.
2. **Consensus Mechanism**: Layer-1 blockchains implement consensus protocols (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof-of-Stake-Spacetime) that allow nodes to agree on the state of the blockchain and validate transactions.
3. **Security**: They provide the security foundation for the entire network, ensuring data integrity and resistance to attacks.
4. **Native Cryptocurrency**: Most Layer-1 blockchains have a native cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin for Bitcoin, Ether for Ethereum Neph for Nephele) used for transactions and incentivizing network participants.
5. **Smart Contract Functionality**: Some Layer-1 blockchains, like Ethereum and Nephele, support smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code.

Layer-1 blockchains are critical as they form the foundation for other solutions and enhancements (like Layer-2 protocols). They provide the essential infrastructure for the operation and security of the entire blockchain ecosystem, enabling various applications from digital currencies to complex decentralized applications.
