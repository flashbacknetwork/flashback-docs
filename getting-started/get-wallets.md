# Get a Wallet

Flashback is EVM-compatible. You can use any Ethereum wallet to get your FLASH tokens, pay in FLASH, and more. Check [here](https://ethereum.org/fr/wallets/). You can find the Flashback network when the main network is live or connect your wallet to the network by reading [the guide](../participate/how-to-guides/use-a-wallet.md).
