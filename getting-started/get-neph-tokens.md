# ðŸª™ FLASH Tokens

Users can pay for Flashback's platform services using both fiat and cryptocurrency, but FLASH tokens will serve as a utility token and native currency within the Flashback ecosystem, facilitating key functions such as payments, staking, and participant incentivization.

FLASH is not listed yet. However, you can potentially get FLASH tokens by:

* Participating as a private investor (KYC).
* Participating in our community and ambassador programs by joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yy8kyM5qFB).
