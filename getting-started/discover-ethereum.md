# Discover Ethereum and Filecoin

Flashback is an Ethereum fork. We ultimately inherit its blockchain architecture. Our comprehensive documentation covers all the primary information needed to understand the network features and how to join our ecosystem. We invite you to discover [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/).&#x20;

Additionally, our technology reuses some abstractions from the Filecoin technology, such as the proofs for file hosting and the sector system. Even though we removed and modified many components, we invite you to read about [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/)[ ](https://docs.filecoin.io/)concerning the proofs and the sector system. It will give you a better understanding of the Flashback network.&#x20;
